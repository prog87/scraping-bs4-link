</script><br/><br/>As I'm doing now, right?<br/>You are him.<br/><br/>You are my one and only true love.<br/><br/>Words, Simone...<br/>-But beautiful words.<br/><br/>Yes. But right now I don't know<br/>what those words mean.<br/><br/>They mean I love you... I'm certain.<br/><br/>There's only one way to find out.<br/>-How?<br/><br/>You don't want to know.<br/><br/>Hi, this is Milan.<br/>I'm away for a while.<br/><br/>I won't be using this number for now,<br/>so you can't leave a message.<br/><br/>Especially not you.<br/><br/>There you go.<br/>-Thanks.<br/><br/>Don't be late next time.<br/><br/>This is Simone from Synovate.<br/>Could I have a moment of your time?<br/><br/>It concerns the ageing of Dutch society.<br/>Can I ask you some questions?<br/><br/>Hi, this is Milan...<br/><br/>Have you... seen... Milan?<br/><br/>Seen... Milan?<br/>-I don't have time for this.<br/><br/>THE BAR<br/><br/>What can I get you?<br/><br/>Could... argh... uh...<br/><br/>I'd...<br/>-Here. Show me.<br/><br/>I told you to show me.<br/><br/>Vegetarian Special.<br/>Anything else?<br/><br/>Enjoy your meal.<br/>Just wave when you need me.<br/><br/>Exactly.<br/><br/>Have you started yet?<br/><br/>Where are you?<br/>-That's not important.<br/><br/>When will I see you again?<br/><br/>Haven't you read my letter yet?<br/><br/>Are you afraid to read it?<br/><br/>Of course not.<br/>-Okay, I'll call again sometime.<br/><br/>Beautiful. Thanks.<br/>-Wasn't it too much?<br/><br/>Not at all. Cut.<br/>Beautiful.<br/><br/>Did you get it right, Martin?<br/>-Yes. Super.<br/><br/>Okay everybody, let's wrap it up.<br/>Tomorrow's another day.<br/><br/>We can discuss that later...<br/><br/>The view makes our job so attractive.<br/><br/>We see them, but they can't see us.<br/>Use it to your advantage.<br/><br/>Good, but you're turning it into<br/>a bit of an act. Don't do that.<br/><br/>I'm trying to add an extra layer here.<br/>Otherwise, the character will be empty.<br/><br/>He's got to have something special<br/>about him, don't you think?<br/><br/>A certain talent.<br/>-He doesn't have to be talented.<br/><br/>Maybe that's the wrong word.<br/><br/>Make him normal.<br/>-Not talented but...<br/><br/>A sort of depth.<br/>-Something special.<br/><br/>Don't you agree? A certain presence.<br/><br/>Actually it's quite simple.<br/>You only have to cut a cucumber.<br/><br/>Why not with a bit of flair?<br/>-It's not theater.<br/><br/>Shall we do it again?<br/>-Just do it again.<br/><br/>It's not theater, it's film.<br/><br/>Make him normal. The film's called<br/>Real Life for a reason. Get it?<br/><br/>I get it, but aren't there people<br/>with talent in real life as well?<br/><br/>Make it less theatrical.<br/>Just cut the vegetables.<br/><br/>You know how to cut.<br/>Teach him.<br/><br/>It'll be fine.<br/>-I'm really trying.<br/><br/>Try less.<br/>Maybe that's it.<br/><br/>The view makes our job so attractive.<br/>-You still have that look.<br/><br/>Hold on. I hadn't even started yet.<br/>Give me space to set it up.<br/><br/>With all due respect.<br/><br/>The view makes our job so attractive.<br/>We see them, but they can't see us.<br/><br/>Use it to your advantage.<br/><br/>Say your lines.<br/><br/>I thought we were just rehearsing<br/>this moment.<br/><br/>I want some coffee.<br/>Irene, can we have coffee?<br/><br/>Come on, guys.<br/>-Martin, come on.<br/><br/>I don't understand him.<br/>-Let's do it again.<br/><br/>But wouldn't it be nice...<br/>-I don't need...<br/><br/>Let me finish. Maybe it's a good idea<br/>if he brings his own knife.<br/><br/>He has his own personal knife.<br/><br/>You definitely won't bring your own knife.<br/>-He stands like this and goes...<br/><br/>He turns around a few times<br/>and then...<br/><br/>Fjodor...<br/>-Something like this.<br/><br/>Not like that, of course.<br/>-Just listen for once.<br/><br/>I've been listening all along.<br/>-Listen and don't interrupt.<br/><br/>You won't turn it into an act.<br/>You won't bring a knife<br/><br/>You come into<br/>a fully-stocked kitchen.<br/><br/>You came in... You...<br/>I don't how how to say it.<br/><br/>You're just cutting a cucumber.<br/>Let's focus on that.<br/><br/>And then everything will be fine.<br/><br/>I'm going to get coffee.<br/>-I'd like a cappuccino.<br/><br/>What do you want?<br/>-Tea, please.<br/><br/>Are we going to do it again?<br/>Or do you want coffee first?<br/><br/>Dirk...<br/><br/>It doesn't matter.<br/>-lt was fine.<br/><br/>Sorry, Simone.<br/>-Again.<br/><br/>I saw Dirk's face again.<br/><br/>Concentration, please.<br/><br/>Action.<br/><br/>Milan?<br/>-Well?<br/><br/>Yes, I found someone.<br/><br/>He's really nice.<br/><br/>Sensitive.<br/><br/>Special.<br/><br/>Are you in love?<br/><br/>Of course.<br/><br/>This way we'll never<br/>see each other again.<br/><br/>I know it's difficult,<br/>but I miss you too.<br/><br/>So come back to me.<br/>-No, we have to persevere.<br/><br/>Otherwise, we're no good.<br/><br/>This proves it too, doesn't it?<br/><br/>I didn't write that letter<br/>for nothing.<br/><br/>Just do as I asked.<br/><br/>Find someone and fall in love.<br/><br/>There you go.<br/>Hey, girl.<br/><br/>Have a seat.<br/>I'll be right with you.<br/><br/>The view makes our job so attractive.<br/><br/>We see them, but they can't see us.<br/><br/>Not like that, Fjodor.<br/><br/>Stand beside me<br/>and look at me.<br/><br/>The view makes our job so attractive.<br/>We see them, but they don't see us.<br/><br/>Who cares?<br/><br/>Sjon, we can talk about this forever,<br/>but you're just here for the tidbits.<br/><br/>Get it?<br/><br/>Do you see this? And this?<br/>Watch.<br/><br/>Tid-bit-tid-bit-tid-bit.<br/><br/>Get it?<br/>Your turn.<br/><br/>Damn it, Fjodor.<br/>Stop it, asshole.<br/><br/>Jesus Christ. You're doing it<br/>on purpose. Get lost.<br/><br/>You don't even give him a chance.<br/>-He doesn't deserve it.<br/><br/>Now what?<br/>-Dirk, come here.<br/><br/>Hey, girl.<br/><br/>Have a seat.<br/>I'll be right with you.<br/><br/>The view makes our job so attractive.<br/>-The camera isn't in position yet.<br/><br/>I told you this wouldn't work.<br/>-Take it easy.<br/><br/>We'll just do it again.<br/>It happens.<br/><br/>My hat isn't comfortable, so...<br/>-Attention, everyone.<br/><br/>Are you ready, Dirk?<br/><br/>Don't worry, everything<br/>will be fine. And action!<br/><br/>The view makes our job so attractive.<br/>You see them, but they can't see you.<br/><br/>Use it to your advantage.<br/><br/>Hey Sjon...<br/><br/>I didn't realize you meant me.<br/><br/>I'm Dirk.<br/>-Arif. Nice to meet you.<br/><br/>Tid-bit-tid-bit. Get it?<br/><br/>Yes. Tid-bit.<br/><br/>Good. Your turn.<br/><br/>Give it to me,<br/>before we have an accident.<br/><br/>Three spareribs and<br/>a Vegetarian Special for the dumbo.<br/><br/>Loes means to say: the dumb one.<br/>-It's sad. She can't talk.<br/><br/>That's what I'm saying.<br/>-I wish you were dumb.<br/><br/>Your yapping makes us all sad.<br/>-Hands off.<br/><br/>Poor girl. It's not easy,<br/>living with a handicap.<br/><br/>Want a drink?<br/><br/>I promised my wife<br/>I wouldn't be late.<br/><br/>Another time?<br/><br/>You did well, man.<br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Bye.<br/><br/>Angelique, whore.<br/>-End board.<br/><br/>Are you okay?<br/><br/>What happened to you, man?<br/>-I fell down the stairs.<br/><br/>Then you probably don't live<br/>on the first floor.<br/><br/>Could I stay at your place tonight?<br/><br/>I had a huge fight with my wife,<br/>Angelique.<br/><br/>Did she do this?<br/>-What the heck happened to you?<br/><br/>I just told you. That...<br/><br/>Sorry, I can't do this.<br/><br/>Can't I just try it<br/>the way I would do it?<br/><br/>I mean, it's not realistic to say:<br/>my wife Angelique...<br/><br/>Take fifteen.<br/><br/>A whisky please.<br/><br/>Could I perhaps...<br/><br/>stay at your place tonight?<br/><br/>I caught my wife in bed<br/>with another man.<br/><br/>Some muscular type.<br/>She likes those.<br/><br/>I don't understand why<br/>I feel so hurt this time.<br/><br/>Has it happened before?<br/>-And you put up with it?<br/><br/>Of course.<br/>What else can I do?<br/><br/>I won't leave my kids with her.<br/>-Your kids?<br/><br/>Doesn't matter. Keep going.<br/><br/>Charity and Lafurtery<br/>are my two little girls.<br/><br/>I sometimes feel that Clarisse...<br/>-Who?<br/><br/>Clarisse.<br/><br/>My wife.<br/>-Oh, your wife... okay<br/><br/>I sometimes feel she only sees me<br/>as my own children's babysitter.<br/><br/>I wish she was more<br/>like she used to be.<br/><br/>But that's the funny thing...<br/><br/>In that tough face of hers<br/>I still see the sweetheart she once was.<br/><br/>She was so pretty,<br/>with gorgeous dark curls like you.<br/><br/>When I think of that,<br/>I can't get angry anymore.<br/><br/>Even though I'd like to.<br/><br/>Even though I'd really like to.<br/><br/>Well done, man.<br/><br/>Maestro.<br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>From now on we'll do everything<br/>the way you would do it.<br/><br/>Beautiful.<br/><br/>That's not right. It says: Sjon.<br/>And I'm Dirk now.<br/><br/>Daddy.<br/>Look behind you.<br/><br/>Sweetie, did that scare you?<br/>-It's just for the film.<br/><br/>Look, it's Paul. It's not real.<br/>-You don't need to be scared.<br/><br/>Wimp. Get lost.<br/>Stay away.<br/><br/>Doormat.<br/><br/>What? Did you think I was making<br/>those hysterical noises?<br/><br/>I thought you were a couple.<br/><br/>No, I choose my men more carefully.<br/><br/>Have some.<br/>-Thanks.<br/><br/>In a while,<br/>he'll start playing guitar.<br/><br/>Just wait.<br/><br/>He always does that.<br/><br/>I guess it's some<br/>twisted kind of shyness.<br/><br/>It can be tough if you have to talk<br/>to girls.<br/><br/>Nice story yesterday<br/>at The Bar.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Can you do the dishes?<br/><br/>I'm not here.<br/><br/>This is Simone from Synovate.<br/><br/>Do you think I could fall in love<br/>with you?<br/><br/>With me?<br/><br/>That's difficult to say.<br/><br/>Why's that?<br/>-Because it's...<br/><br/>It's just that it's easy<br/>to hurt each other.<br/><br/>Have you ever hurt anyone?<br/><br/>Or were you the one<br/>who was hurt?<br/><br/>I'm sorry.<br/>-Go on. Don't be shy.<br/><br/>Suddenly she started talking about love.<br/>-That was wonderful.<br/><br/>I didn't know.<br/>-lt was just so...<br/><br/>Funny?<br/>-lt doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Are you still there?<br/><br/>I'll be right back.<br/><br/>Why didn't you tell me earlier?<br/>I have to go to work.<br/><br/>That jerk put the alarm<br/>an hour behind.<br/><br/>Tjaltje, I wanted some quality time<br/>together. So what?<br/><br/>Hey, what's wrong with you?<br/>-He's still worried about his wife.<br/><br/>Wimp. If you want your wife back,<br/>take a girlfriend.<br/><br/>You can't just take someone.<br/>-Why not?<br/><br/>I took you.<br/>A few times even.<br/><br/>Bye.<br/><br/>This beats cooking.<br/><br/>Can you get that?<br/><br/>Anyone there?<br/><br/>Hey girl, you look good.<br/><br/>Daily Dish or Vegetarian?<br/><br/>Vegetarian. And to drink:<br/>red, white?<br/><br/>If she has the hiccups but is still<br/>at it, you're doing something right.<br/><br/>'Vegetarian' for the dumbo.<br/><br/>Not so loud. She'll hear you.<br/>-Why? I'm not saying anything wrong, am l?<br/><br/>So, you were really going at it?<br/>-Powerfully.<br/><br/>At every hiccup I was ejected.<br/>I've never experienced that before.<br/><br/>Keep going.<br/>-At every hiccup I was ejected.<br/><br/>At every hiccup I was ejected.<br/><br/>Such power. I've never<br/>experienced that before.<br/><br/>Me neither.<br/>Must be a matter of size.<br/><br/>What do you mean by that?<br/><br/>That your little Luke is rather small, Luke.<br/>-Or Tjaltje's hiccups were very bad.<br/><br/>Let's talk about you.<br/>-About me?<br/><br/>Loes, we need female input.<br/><br/>Suppose Dirk loves his wife.<br/>-He does, judging by his stories.<br/><br/>But she cheats on him a lot.<br/>What should he do to get her back?<br/><br/>Get a girlfriend, probably.<br/>-You see?<br/><br/>But I don't want a girlfriend.<br/>-That doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Loes, how do you feel about Dirk?<br/>-Well, Luke, that's an idea.<br/><br/>Could be interesting. Bald.<br/>Sturdily built. A good cook.<br/><br/>That's no coincidence, my friend.<br/><br/>What isn't?<br/>-That you're looking at dumbo.<br/><br/>It's just...<br/>-She's the perfect candidate.<br/><br/>And she won't ever<br/>sound smarter than you.<br/><br/>Dear Simone,<br/>As I was trying to tell you...<br/><br/>I can't trust you anymore<br/>so something has to happen.<br/><br/>I guess it will take some time<br/>before you can forgive me this.<br/><br/>I know it will be hard,<br/>but I want you to forget me.<br/><br/>I've disappeared, as you can see.<br/><br/>I won't return until I feel you've<br/>found happiness with someone else.<br/><br/>Only then will I know<br/>what we truly mean to each other.<br/><br/>And then you'll have to choose.<br/><br/>I have to know. So, please,<br/>search for someone you like.<br/><br/>Someone you can trust<br/>and feel safe with.<br/><br/>But search for someone<br/>you can start over with.<br/><br/>Only then will I return.<br/><br/>Only then.<br/><br/>Hey, Luke.<br/><br/>Usually, it only lasts one night.<br/><br/>Hurry up.<br/>This is your chance, man.<br/><br/>Go and say hi.<br/><br/>I think you forgot something.<br/><br/>The letter.<br/><br/>Don't I get a kiss<br/>as finder's fee?<br/><br/>Sorry, I was into...<br/>-This is not a porn movie.<br/><br/>I understand, but it was just<br/>a passionate kiss.<br/><br/>When I read the script...<br/><br/>Did you read it?<br/>-A few times even.<br/><br/>Do you want to do it again?<br/>-lf differently, yes.<br/><br/>Kissing, but no tonguing.<br/>That looks better.<br/><br/>Unless you want to.<br/>-That's okay.<br/><br/>Could I fall in love with you?<br/><br/>I'm not going to...<br/><br/>No, sorry.<br/><br/>Nice house.<br/><br/>Sorry, I didn't know it was you.<br/>Please don't take it personally.<br/><br/>Too bad... It's just a movie, Dirk.<br/>You're only acting.<br/><br/>I was sleeping.<br/>I didn't know it was her.<br/><br/>Even better.<br/>'Dirk' didn't know either.<br/><br/>I am Dirk, Martin. You should<br/>tell me these things beforehand.<br/><br/>In real life you don't know<br/>how things end up either.<br/><br/>Fine. It failed.<br/>We'll do it as we wrote it.<br/><br/>It's sick,<br/>the way you treat your girlfriend.<br/><br/>Pardon me?<br/><br/>All those weird sex things you make<br/>her do: you treat her like some whore.<br/><br/>Don't you see<br/>this it's hard for her too?<br/><br/>Right?<br/>-It's okay.<br/><br/>It's not. You don't have to do this.<br/>You're not like this.<br/><br/>Don't think a simple<br/>grip like you...<br/><br/>...can understand someone<br/>as complex as Simone.<br/><br/>As if you know everything...<br/>mister hotshot director.<br/><br/>There you are: this awkwardness is<br/>what I need.<br/><br/>Is the camera still running?<br/>-Did you say 'cut'?<br/><br/>Now then: cut. Okay?<br/><br/>Is it turned off?<br/>-Almost.<br/><br/>What is this, guys?<br/>Are we shooting a film, or what?<br/><br/>Good. Thank you.<br/>Thank you for your cooperation.<br/><br/>Anyone there?<br/><br/>What? Who?<br/><br/>She's sleeping.<br/>Can I take a message?<br/><br/>You may want to talk to her,<br/>but you can't. She can't speak.<br/><br/>Then why does she have a phone?<br/><br/>Good point.<br/>-Could I ask you some questions then?<br/><br/>I'm not going to participate<br/>in a survey at 1 a.m.<br/><br/>Haven't I spoken to you before?<br/>-Me?<br/><br/>No.<br/>-I did. I recognize your voice.<br/><br/>Is it that special?<br/>-You were mean to hang up on me.<br/><br/>That wasn't very kind.<br/>-I didn't mean to be unkind...<br/><br/>Look behind you.<br/><br/>Jesus.<br/><br/>You probably want to go now,<br/>but I hope you'll stay.<br/><br/>You pretended you couldn't talk?<br/>-Yes. But I can't anymore.<br/><br/>I want to show you my real self.<br/>-You don't have to.<br/><br/>I always knew you were different.<br/><br/>From the moment I saw you<br/>in the bathroom mirror.<br/><br/>You mean in the restaurant?<br/>-No, here in the bathroom.<br/><br/>No, you mean...<br/>-Right. In the restaurant.<br/><br/>From the kitchen,<br/>by way of the mirror...<br/><br/>You were always sitting there<br/>with food, wine.<br/><br/>And cut. Thanks.<br/>Very nice.<br/><br/>And... you wake up now.<br/><br/>It's been a long night.<br/>A lot of things happened.<br/><br/>Look, who's that?<br/>You don't know her.<br/><br/>You feel bad and guilty about<br/>what happened. How could you do this?<br/><br/>No kiss.<br/>That's history.<br/><br/>You feel...no.<br/>You're leaving and you think...<br/><br/>I don't want him to.<br/>-Simone, you're just sleeping.<br/><br/>Rolling.<br/><br/>This time you leave. Go!<br/><br/>You're guilty. You feel bad. Scram.<br/>-A kiss.<br/><br/>Stupid cow.<br/>You're ruining my film.<br/><br/>I think Dirk's right.<br/>-Listen, he has to feel guilty.<br/><br/>The glow is gone.<br/>He feels bad about himself.<br/><br/>But I feel great.<br/>-Not you. Him, idiot.<br/><br/>In real life we'd fuck like crazy.<br/><br/>Like any couple that just met.<br/>-That's what I'm saying.<br/><br/>Where's my script?<br/>-Right here.<br/><br/>Take a five-minute break,<br/>because you're stressed out.<br/><br/>No reason.<br/>Because I'm happy.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Didn't you think sex was overrated?<br/>-That was before I met you.<br/><br/>What are you doing here?<br/><br/>I hadn't seen you for a while.<br/>I wondered how you were.<br/><br/>So you just sneak in unasked?<br/>-You left these.<br/><br/>So I considered that to be<br/>an open invitation.<br/><br/>Judging by my mail,<br/>you haven't been by for a while.<br/><br/>But you've been busy, I see.<br/><br/>Hi, I'm Milan, Simone's boyfriend.<br/>-Dirk. Nice to meet you.<br/><br/>He's polite.<br/>That's to his credit.<br/><br/>You have to ask these things first.<br/><br/>Do I need your permission<br/>to kiss my girlfriend?<br/><br/>No, hers.<br/><br/>He's emancipated. It's getting<br/>better and better, guys.<br/><br/>You're sick.<br/>-Undoubtedly.<br/><br/>But tell me:<br/>what are you going to do?<br/><br/>I'm out.<br/>-Weakling. Giving up already?<br/><br/>In real life you don't get away<br/>with those games of yours.<br/><br/>What are you talking about?<br/><br/>I told him he's free to go.<br/>-Does that mean what I think it does?<br/><br/>I leave that up to you.<br/><br/>You heard her. Get lost.<br/>-Take it easy, little clown.<br/><br/>Good catch.<br/><br/>You were hard to reach,<br/>so answer the phone next time.<br/><br/>That's up to her.<br/><br/>Tough case, that guy.<br/>-You got that right.<br/><br/>I'm a lot easier.<br/><br/>Is he really your boyfriend?<br/>-He was.<br/><br/>Do you still love him?<br/><br/>I did. But...<br/><br/>But now I just feel...<br/><br/>A...<br/>-A?<br/><br/>A hard dick against my ass.<br/>-Damn it, Simone. Really.<br/><br/>Stop behaving like you're in highschool.<br/>Please stick to the script.<br/><br/>Shouldn't you be out in the rain,<br/>looking pathetic?<br/><br/>Or should I throw you out again, 'Milan'?<br/><br/>Why did you come barging in like that?<br/>-I had to know what he meant to you.<br/><br/>And?<br/><br/>I missed you so much.<br/><br/>If you only knew how tough this is<br/>for me. For you too.<br/><br/>It's good that it's tough<br/>and that we're doing this.<br/><br/>It's good, because it's tough.<br/>-Stop it.<br/><br/>Are you trying to make me jealous?<br/>-It's not that.<br/><br/>I can understand you want<br/>to make me jealous. That's fine.<br/><br/>But we shouldn't quit.<br/>-I'm done.<br/><br/>So let's start all over.<br/>-I can't go back.<br/><br/>Of course we can go back.<br/><br/>You're out of luck, because I met<br/>Dirk. He's different.<br/><br/>He's real. You don't always<br/>need to play games.<br/><br/>Why did you phone me?<br/><br/>I love you.<br/>-Words.<br/><br/>But beautiful words.<br/>-Very beautiful. Bye.<br/><br/>Cut.<br/>Endboard.<br/><br/>Mister lover lover. How was it?<br/><br/>Come on. How is she?<br/>Does she taste good?<br/><br/>I'm not going to...<br/><br/>I'm glad you're here.<br/>So you can train your new assistant.<br/><br/>I have an assistant?<br/>-Yes. An assistant kitchen assistant.<br/><br/>Hi, I'm Milan.<br/><br/>Since you walked off duty<br/>for some 'hubba-hubba'...<br/><br/>With or without?<br/><br/>I'll go without.<br/><br/>And cut.<br/><br/>You're a natural.<br/>-Thank you, chef.<br/><br/>I'm going to like it here, I think.<br/><br/>Sorry, Milan. Would you be so kind<br/>and clean that up?<br/><br/>Of course, mister Dirk.<br/>If I can be of service to you.<br/><br/>One has to start at the bottom.<br/><br/>Stop. Good take...<br/>Mark, could you clean up this mess?<br/><br/>Boss...<br/><br/>I put it on again.<br/><br/>I hear you're dating a dumbo.<br/>-She's not a dumbo.<br/><br/>No, she's dumb.<br/><br/>And I hear she's gorgeous.<br/><br/>She just has a bad taste in men.<br/><br/>Funny for you to say.<br/>Since you're dating.<br/><br/>Actually I meant her ex.<br/>He's a strange guy.<br/><br/>Did you meet him?<br/>-Unfortunately, yes.<br/><br/>That must have been awkward.<br/>Was he jealous?<br/><br/>I don't know. Not my problem.<br/>-lt can become a nuisance.<br/><br/>A stalking ex on your tail.<br/>-I'm not worried.<br/><br/>He was a sad case.<br/><br/>But are you sure he's her ex?<br/>Maybe they still have a relationship.<br/><br/>No, she really likes me.<br/>-How can you be sure?<br/><br/>Maybe she's playing some weird game.<br/><br/>Then you wouldn't be making<br/>a fool of yourself, 'Milan'.<br/><br/>On the contrary, Dirk.<br/><br/>This one's fine for me.<br/>-And cut.<br/><br/>Hey, girl.<br/><br/>What a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Do you know each other?<br/>-Will you tell them or should l?<br/><br/>Stop it.<br/>You know she can't talk.<br/><br/>Don't mind Milan, honey.<br/><br/>Do you want a drink?<br/><br/>Are you thirsty?<br/>-Not really.<br/><br/>He's fine.<br/><br/>Did you see that?<br/><br/>She's not a dumbo.<br/>-I keep saying it's 'dumb.'<br/><br/>She's been acting all along.<br/>What a bitch.<br/><br/>They seemed such a nice couple.<br/>-lncredible.<br/><br/>I thought he only cared<br/>about his wife.<br/><br/>His wife?<br/>-Yes. His wife.<br/><br/>He got himself a girlfriend<br/>to get his wife back.<br/><br/>Or so I thought.<br/>-ls he married?<br/><br/>Tjaltje says: 'lt only works<br/>if you're in love.'<br/><br/>Why are you hanging out with Tjaltje?<br/>-She's sensitive.<br/><br/>She makes those sensitive sounds.<br/>-Hiccups are normal.<br/><br/>This is Martin Zomer calling<br/>from the set of 'Real Life.'<br/><br/>I'd like to ask you<br/>if the children are there.<br/><br/>Anything else?<br/>-No, thank you.<br/><br/>Don't you recognize me?<br/>-Not really. No idea.<br/><br/>I'm your wife. Clarisse.<br/>And you are?<br/><br/>You have a wife?<br/><br/>Do you have a wife?<br/>-Apparently.<br/><br/>She says so.<br/><br/>Bad casting...<br/>-You two look terrible together.<br/><br/>I agree.<br/>Can't you play my wife?<br/><br/>I never drink beer actually.<br/>-Me neither.<br/><br/>BAD LlVER<br/><br/>Kiss her again, Dirk.<br/><br/>And...action.<br/><br/>Do you recognize these two?<br/>-Sweethearts.<br/><br/>Were you really kissing her?<br/>-Just for the film. Come on.<br/><br/>Listen up. I don't give a shit about<br/>what you do to me...<br/><br/>but keep your filthy hands<br/>off my kids.<br/><br/>It's not my fault your wife brought<br/>the kids. Insert on his face.<br/><br/>I'll insert your face somewhere, Martin.<br/>-Milan, the name's Milan. I know it's difficult.<br/><br/>Let's not forget it was your idea<br/>to give the kids a cameo role.<br/><br/>They only had to sleep, asshole.<br/>This was very different.<br/><br/>Yes, like you were only supposed to act<br/>that you'd steal Simone from me.<br/><br/>Why don't you hit me?<br/><br/>You'd like that, wouldn't you?<br/><br/>I'm leaving.<br/>Are you coming?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>That was very good, but I'd still<br/>like to do it again.<br/><br/>Get lost with your stupid film.<br/>-You sit down in your trailer.<br/><br/>Someone get my script in order.<br/>We'll gladly do it again.<br/><br/>That was good.<br/>Take a two-minute break.<br/><br/>I owe you my thanks.<br/><br/>You taught me not to be afraid<br/>of my feelings.<br/><br/>You're welcome.<br/><br/>Your example gave me<br/>the courage I needed.<br/><br/>Were you expecting someone else?<br/><br/>Can I come in, or...?<br/><br/>Sweetie.<br/><br/>Shouldn't you be with your wife?<br/><br/>That wasn't my wife,<br/>it was an actress...<br/><br/>Clarisse is Surinamese.<br/>-You lied to me.<br/><br/>You used me.<br/><br/>I thought I'd found someone<br/>who was honest and real.<br/><br/>Like your boyfriend with my kids.<br/>-Clarisse did that.<br/><br/>Are you two playing games with me?<br/><br/>The grip gets to fool around with<br/>the gorgeous girl and then gets dumped?<br/><br/>Kitchen assistent.<br/>-What?<br/><br/>Kitchen assistent.<br/>You said 'grip.'<br/><br/>Okay.<br/>Kitchen assistent.<br/><br/>Sweetie.<br/><br/>You were right... Dirk is just as<br/>much of a lowlife as you are.<br/><br/>So?<br/><br/>Can't we start over?<br/>-I thought that wasn't possible.<br/><br/>It is.<br/><br/>I was wrong. I'm sorry.<br/>-Right. You're sorry.<br/><br/>And now the last line:<br/>'l love you. Really.'<br/><br/>Easy to say when he's awaiting you.<br/>-He's gone.<br/><br/>Is he?<br/>-Yes.<br/><br/>Is he really? And here?<br/>Is he gone here as well?<br/><br/>How can I be sure?<br/><br/>I have to say this:<br/>You created it, you solve it.<br/><br/>What do you want me to do?<br/>-I want you...<br/><br/>to do to him...<br/><br/>what you should have done<br/>in the first place.<br/><br/>Tomorrow.<br/><br/>And in my presence.<br/>-I promise.<br/><br/>Tomorrow I'll break up with him.<br/>In The Bar.<br/><br/>So you can watch.<br/><br/>Then you can't kiss me<br/>until tomorrow.<br/><br/>You're sick.<br/>-You're beautiful.<br/><br/>Beautifully sick.<br/><br/>And cut.<br/><br/>Research into the emotional life<br/>of the Dutch...<br/><br/>have proven not to be accurate.<br/>Therefore, we need further data.<br/><br/>Could you please tell me if you<br/>believe in love at first sight?<br/><br/>Pardon me?<br/>-I believe in love at first sight.<br/><br/>I have no more questions.<br/>Goodbye.<br/><br/>What are you doing here?<br/>-I have to tell you something.<br/><br/>I'm working now. I'll meet you later,<br/>for a drink at The Bar.<br/><br/>I'm busy.<br/><br/>This is the most important thing<br/>I've ever said to anyone.<br/><br/>Don't be silly.<br/>-Do you recognize this?<br/><br/>Give it to me.<br/>-When you've found someone...<br/><br/>you really love,<br/>you have to choose.<br/><br/>Only then will I know what we<br/>truly mean to each other.<br/><br/>How could you do this?<br/>I may have lied about my wife...<br/><br/>but what you did is just as bad.<br/>And Milan is even worse.<br/><br/>If he dares to ask<br/>something like that...<br/><br/>he not only doesn't respect you...<br/><br/>he simply doesn't love you.<br/>This letter proves it. Treasure it.<br/><br/>I...<br/><br/>I wish you...<br/>-Lots of luck in life.<br/><br/>Lots of luck<br/>with the rest of your...<br/><br/>with the rest...<br/>There's one more thing.<br/><br/>Before I leave, I want to say that<br/>these past few weeks have been...<br/><br/>the most beautiful<br/>of my life.<br/><br/>I'd like to thank you for that.<br/>-You're welcome.<br/><br/>I see so much love<br/>in your eyes.<br/><br/>I'm so proud someone like you<br/>likes me.<br/><br/>I have to go.<br/>-Wait.<br/><br/>Let me go.<br/>-I just don't get it.<br/><br/>Remember what you said in the hotel?<br/>Remember?<br/><br/>That you could be<br/>yourself with me.<br/><br/>I don't want you, get it?<br/>-You even wanted to take the kids...<br/><br/>to an amusement park<br/>to get to know them.<br/><br/>Stop it.<br/>It was my job.<br/><br/>I did it for the film.<br/><br/>You were so very shy. I had to do<br/>something to loosen you up.<br/><br/>We're not a good fit.<br/><br/>Don't you see that?<br/><br/>No, I don't.<br/><br/>Action.<br/><br/>Jesus... Milan.<br/><br/>I thought you'd gone home.<br/>-Would you have preferred that?<br/><br/>Of course not.<br/><br/>What's wrong?<br/>Why aren't you in bed?<br/><br/>Why do you think?<br/>I can't sleep.<br/><br/>I've had that strange woman<br/>in my head all day. Woman. Girl.<br/><br/>A girl who apparently spends nights...<br/><br/>in a hotel with a stranger<br/>talking about his kids...<br/><br/>and amusement parks.<br/>-What are you doing?<br/><br/>I love you, Simone.<br/><br/>I love you.<br/>-Sweetheart.<br/><br/>What's wrong?<br/><br/>You cheated on me before my own eyes.<br/><br/>You gave yourself so easily to him.<br/><br/>As if it didn't cost you any effort.<br/>-That's because I knew it was you.<br/><br/>Yeah, right. Dirk and l<br/>really resemble each other.<br/><br/>Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>Shit. Damn it.<br/><br/>Yes, and what do we do now?<br/>You and your deadpan expression.<br/><br/>Damn it. Were you this invulnerable<br/>and aloof with Dirk as well?<br/><br/>A total blank<br/>so it seems real.<br/><br/>You're such a...<br/>Camera on her.<br/><br/>Do what you have to do to seem sweet.<br/><br/>You're such a great faker.<br/>-So are you.<br/><br/>With you everything could be fake.<br/>-But it isn't.<br/><br/>You know I love you.<br/>-You'd say the same to him.<br/><br/>As I'm doing now, right?<br/>You are him.<br/><br/>You are my one and only true love.<br/><br/>Words.<br/>-But beautiful words.<br/><br/>Yes, beautiful...<br/>This is bullshit, guys.<br/><br/>Damn it.<br/>-Martin.<br/><br/>My name is Milan.<br/><br/>Finish the scene.<br/>-I forgot.<br/><br/>But beautiful words.<br/><br/>Yes. But right now I don't know<br/>what those words mean.<br/><br/>They mean I love you... I'm certain.<br/><br/>How does it feel<br/>to outsmart everyone?<br/><br/>Keep going.<br/>You're almost there.<br/><br/>Don't you understand<br/>for who I did all this?<br/><br/>Not for me, in any case.<br/><br/>Is that what you think?<br/><br/>Martin, come.<br/><br/>Come here for a minute.<br/><br/>Please.<br/><br/>What did you do?<br/><br/>What did you do?<br/><br/>I still had some scenes with him.<br/><br/>You've got all you need now?<br/><br/>I think so.</div>
