</script><br/><br/>- What was the matter?<br/>- I'm all right now.<br/><br/>But when nobody came, I got up by myself...<br/><br/>and everyone was dead.<br/><br/>I think I'll just have<br/>a look round the back here.<br/><br/>Could I have a drink, please?<br/><br/>Hmm? Oh, sure.<br/><br/>What'll you have?<br/><br/>Oh, whiskey will be fine.<br/><br/>That's fine. Thank you.<br/><br/>Here's to you, Mrs. Taggart.<br/><br/>I'm not Mrs. Taggart.<br/><br/>He said it would be safer<br/>if we told people that.<br/><br/>- You're not married?<br/>- Mm-mmm.<br/><br/>I was married. My husband died last year.<br/>My name's Peggy Haddon.<br/><br/>- You never met Taggart before then.<br/>- No.<br/><br/>Yes, I could do with a drink.<br/>What's north of here?<br/><br/>Same as south... nothing.<br/><br/>- What are your plans?<br/>- Well, there must be some people left...<br/><br/>accidents like ourselves...<br/>and they'll head for the nearest town.<br/><br/>I thought I might hang around for a day<br/>or so and see if anyone showed up.<br/><br/>- Why?<br/>- If we intend to survive,<br/><br/>- we'll need all the help we can get.<br/>- You're kidding yourself, Nolan.<br/><br/>What happened earlier this morning,<br/>that was no accident.<br/><br/>Whoever did it has won the war.<br/><br/>All they've got to do<br/>is to move in and take over.<br/><br/>And then it's every man for himself.<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>Small world, my friend.<br/><br/>I thought you were dead!<br/><br/>Maybe... Maybe we all are.<br/><br/>Vi!<br/><br/>Vi, we've got company.<br/><br/>- I'm Ed... I'm Ed Otis.<br/>- Jeff Nolan.<br/><br/>This is Vi... Violet Courtland.<br/><br/>Oh, I am pleased to see you.<br/><br/>Eddie and I didn't know what to do.<br/><br/>We were scared to death.<br/>That's why we hid in the grocer's.<br/><br/>- I said, "At least we'd be able to eat."<br/>- Let's get to the hotel.<br/><br/>- There's some others there too.<br/>- Then it is just a local thing.<br/><br/>- I knew I was right.<br/>- We'd better go. Come along.<br/><br/>- Here we are.<br/>- Thank you. You're a dear.<br/><br/>Now then. Now Otis is buying.<br/>What is your pleasure? Vi?<br/><br/>No more, Eddie love.<br/><br/>Can't I sweeten your tea for you, love?<br/><br/>Oh, it's not like you to turn down<br/>a drink. Oh, well. Cheers.<br/><br/>You know, I haven't a thing to wear.<br/><br/>I hope things don't go back to normal<br/>until I can get a proper wardrobe.<br/><br/>I don't think things will<br/>be normal for quite a while.<br/><br/>Then you do know something<br/>about it. I thought you did.<br/><br/>Let me ask you a question.<br/>Where were you when all this happened?<br/><br/>At our company party...<br/>25th anniversary of Chempex Limited.<br/><br/>Oh, and nothing happened<br/>to anyone else at the party?<br/><br/>You see, Vi and I, we kind of sneaked away.<br/>She was feeling a bit under the weather.<br/><br/>So we went into one of the labs<br/>where they have a sofa there...<br/><br/>in case any of the staff<br/>want to stay overnight.<br/><br/>- He didn't ask for your life history, love.<br/>- In the morning they were gone.<br/><br/>- What kind of a lab?<br/>- Oh, just a lab... cultures.<br/><br/>Well, then the air is treated<br/>to prevent contamination.<br/><br/>Well, I don't see what business<br/>this is of yours.<br/><br/>Just this: You and Otis were in a lab<br/>with treated ventilation.<br/><br/>Peggy was in a hospital under an oxygen tent.<br/><br/>I was in a plane on an altitude test. That...<br/><br/>- Where were you, Taggart?<br/>- What you're trying to say is<br/><br/>- it was a gas attack, right?<br/>- That's right, a gas attack.<br/><br/>Then why weren't we all killed<br/>when we came out into the air?<br/><br/>Well, it rained yesterday quite heavily.<br/><br/>If the gas was soluble in water<br/>then that could've saved us.<br/><br/>Oh, there was a funny smell... mushrooms.<br/><br/>Can't get anything else<br/>on this whole damn dial!<br/><br/>Otis, you're familiar with this area.<br/>Did you ever hear that sound?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>It seems to be in all the bands at<br/>that frequency... even the television.<br/><br/>But who spread the gas?<br/>Surely you could get them on that.<br/><br/>You're welcome to try, my dear lady.<br/>I can't get any other country.<br/><br/>Not even a ship. Nothing.<br/><br/>- What's the matter?<br/>- That's a lie! The ships are all right!<br/><br/>Now... Now don't... don't worry, Vi.<br/>Don't worry.<br/><br/>- He's all right.<br/>- Take your hands off me.<br/><br/>- Her son's at sea.<br/>- Take your hands off me, Eddie!<br/><br/>What's the use of an army or an air force?<br/><br/>I haven't seen a plane since...<br/>since it happened.<br/><br/>Oh, they've come!<br/><br/>Oh, thank God! I'll go and tell them<br/>we're here. It's the air force.<br/><br/>Vi! Vi, come back here! Vi!<br/><br/>Stop!<br/><br/>Stop!<br/><br/>Please don't go away!<br/><br/>There's more of us over at the hotel.<br/><br/>Oh, please, don't go away.<br/><br/>Stop.<br/><br/>They're space suits.<br/><br/>I don't recognize 'em.<br/><br/>Stop! Stop!<br/><br/>We're over here. I'll show you.<br/><br/>You better stay here. Come on, Taggart.<br/><br/>She's dead.<br/><br/>- She's dead.<br/>- I'll help you. Better get her inside.<br/><br/>You and I made a bargain.<br/>Staying in a crowd's no good.<br/><br/>The sooner we get out of here the better.<br/><br/>I'm not going with you.<br/><br/>- You better park this.<br/>- Is that an order, sir?<br/><br/>Over by the sports car.<br/><br/>I'm Jeff Nolan.<br/><br/>I'm Lorna Brainard,<br/>and this is my husband, Mel.<br/><br/>We better get to the hotel.<br/>It's warmer inside.<br/><br/>- Nice car you're driving.<br/>- Yeah. Found it.<br/><br/>Come on in by the fire.<br/><br/>Now look. We've got to get cracking.<br/>I'm taking her to her mother's.<br/><br/>- Where's that?<br/>- Liverpool.<br/><br/>- Where'd you come from yesterday?<br/>- London.<br/><br/>I don't think you'll find it any different.<br/><br/>You think there's something out there?<br/><br/>We know there's something out there.<br/><br/>That's all we need...<br/>a cheeky kid and a pregnant girl.<br/><br/>They're probably the most important<br/>people on earth right now.<br/><br/>Where were you yesterday when it hit?<br/><br/>We don't even know what it was.<br/>I just don't understand it.<br/><br/>- Look, what difference does it make?<br/>- Well, I don't mind telling you.<br/><br/>- Lorna!<br/>- Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of.<br/><br/>A year ago, Mel and I ran up<br/>to London. We got married.<br/><br/>We weren't doing very well. My mother wrote<br/>and told us we could go and stay with her...<br/><br/>at least till the baby was born.<br/><br/>All right, if you want<br/>everyone to know our business.<br/><br/>We started north without any money.<br/><br/>The first night we, uh, broke into<br/>this air-raid shelter and slept there.<br/><br/>When we came out the next day,<br/>everyone was dead.<br/><br/>We think it was a gas attack.<br/><br/>This air-raid shelter was probably equipped<br/>to prevent air contamination...<br/><br/>- from fallout and radiation.<br/>- I wouldn't know.<br/><br/>If it was a gas attack, who did it?<br/><br/>- How about that, Professor?<br/>- We don't know.<br/><br/>We can't raise anybody<br/>or anything on the shortwave...<br/><br/>and as far as we're concerned,<br/>it's no country on earth.<br/><br/>Oh, maybe those little men<br/>from Mars are back again.<br/><br/>They're real enough and big enough!<br/>They killed Vi!<br/><br/>Look... You mean you've<br/>actually seen these things?<br/><br/>- Two men in space suits.<br/>- Yeah, but at least they're men.<br/><br/>I emptied this in one of them,<br/>and he walked away.<br/><br/>Have you got men like that<br/>where you come from?<br/><br/>Well, why are we all standing here talking?<br/><br/>Vi's dead upstairs,<br/>and those things are still outside.<br/><br/>We're gonna get out of here.<br/><br/>You'd be better off if we stick together.<br/>Otis, you know this area pretty well.<br/><br/>Where can we find some weapons<br/>to defend ourselves?<br/><br/>Well, there's a drill hall east of the village.<br/>I don't know what you'll find there.<br/><br/>They use it mainly for meetings<br/>and civil defense and so on.<br/><br/>Let's go see what they have.<br/>We'll go in my car.<br/><br/>- Now mind how you go, Lorna.<br/>- Oh, dear.<br/><br/>That's it. Out you come.<br/><br/>Ooh.<br/><br/>- Well, maybe you could break the lock.<br/>- No, we may need it.<br/><br/>- There must be another way in.<br/>- Now let me try it.<br/><br/>Here.<br/><br/>That does it.<br/><br/>- Be my guest. It's worth a chance.<br/>- Let's have a look around.<br/><br/>- Just a few cots.<br/>- They're only drill rifles. No firing pins.<br/><br/>Mel, toss me a rifle.<br/><br/>You find any rifles?<br/><br/>No rifles, but they've got<br/>some workable automatics here.<br/><br/>- Here's some ammo.<br/>- One, two, three, four. Testing.<br/><br/>- One, two, three, four. Testing.<br/>- Mel. Mel.<br/><br/>- Otis. Otis, come on.<br/>- I don't even know how to use these things.<br/><br/>- Just put the bullets in here like that.<br/>- Hmm?<br/><br/>Close the breech.<br/><br/>Safety catch. Now you know.<br/><br/>Maybe you were right, Mel. Perhaps<br/>we should try and get back to Liverpool.<br/><br/>We can't walk out on them now, can we?<br/><br/>- Let's get back to the hotel.<br/>- But, Mel, we...<br/><br/>- Hmm.<br/>- Thank you.<br/><br/>And if you had gone back to the States,<br/>what would you have done?<br/><br/>Oh, I had a lot of problems that I thought<br/>were pretty important then.<br/><br/>I passed the age for flying, and the company<br/>wanted to give me a desk job-test planning.<br/><br/>- You didn't want a desk job?<br/>- Mm-mmm. No, it wasn't that.<br/><br/>I just reached one of those turning points...<br/><br/>where I thought I might take<br/>some inventory of myself.<br/><br/>Those problems were solved the hard way.<br/><br/>Ooh, time for the changing of the guard.<br/><br/>I better get Otis. See you both later.<br/><br/>Oh, honey.<br/><br/>Aw, there.<br/><br/>Somebody might get killed<br/>if you don't stay awake.<br/><br/>My doctor says I'm taking<br/>the same chance with this.<br/><br/>- Why drink if it's gonna kill ya?<br/>- Well, I don't normally.<br/><br/>Just occasional drink at a party.<br/><br/>What difference does it make now?<br/><br/>Makes all the difference in the world.<br/>You're needed now.<br/><br/>You know, I think you're<br/>whistling in the dark, Nolan.<br/><br/>We're never, never going to get<br/>out of this wretched village.<br/><br/>- Who's that?<br/>- Taggart.<br/><br/>Getting a bit nippy out there.<br/><br/>- See anything?<br/>- No, all quiet.<br/><br/>There's an old stable which might<br/>keep off some of the wind.<br/><br/>Well, I'll... I'll get my coat.<br/><br/>I'll take over for Mel.<br/><br/>Hmm.<br/><br/>I've got your dinner warming<br/>in the oven. I'll get it for you.<br/><br/>Good. I could use it.<br/><br/>- What's the matter with Otis?<br/>- Oh, he's just plain scared.<br/><br/>Trying to drink himself to death.<br/><br/>- Can't really blame him.<br/>- I can.<br/><br/>- As long as there's a chance.<br/>- Maybe he thinks there isn't.<br/><br/>- Haven't you ever felt that way?<br/>- No, and I don't think I ever will.<br/><br/>You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?<br/><br/>Well, maybe I'm just lucky.<br/><br/>What have you got in there?<br/><br/>I'll show you.<br/><br/>- Mel!<br/>- Where'd you get those?<br/><br/>At the bank. They've got a special today.<br/><br/>All you want for nothing. Help yourself.<br/><br/>Oh, Mel, you shouldn't take it...<br/>even if it isn't worth anything.<br/><br/>Why not?<br/><br/>Absolutely useless.<br/><br/>You can't eat it. You can't wear it.<br/>You can't even write on it.<br/><br/>You know, it's funny.<br/><br/>Three days ago, I'd have done<br/>anything for that much money.<br/><br/>Anything... blown up a building,<br/>committed murder.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, I would. You don't know.<br/><br/>I wanted money so bad I could taste it.<br/><br/>This would've been for a house.<br/>This would've been for a car.<br/><br/>Decent clothes for you. Clothes for me.<br/><br/>A telly, a washing machine, furniture...<br/><br/>good furniture.<br/><br/>A place to go on a holiday. Cruise.<br/><br/>That was a week ago.<br/>When I needed it, I couldn't get it.<br/><br/>What the devil's the use of it now?<br/><br/>Don't do that!<br/><br/>Wha...<br/><br/>- I... I don't understand.<br/>- She came at me. I shot her. They all saw it.<br/><br/>You didn't have to shoot her! Aah! Aah!<br/><br/>Let him alone!<br/><br/>- You said that she was dead.<br/>- She was.<br/><br/>She was alive enough tonight...<br/>except her eyes.<br/><br/>Well, what was the matter with them?<br/><br/>She hasn't got any eyes, just gray blobs.<br/><br/>She walked right at me.<br/><br/>She couldn't have been alive.<br/><br/>How do you think she got down here?<br/>Anybody carry her?<br/><br/>She walked, my friend.<br/>She was alive, all right.<br/><br/>When I shot her, she fell down<br/>and she bled just like anybody else.<br/><br/>- What do you think now, Professor?<br/>- Hmm?<br/><br/>We better get back to the drill hall for<br/>tonight. We'll head south in the morning.<br/><br/>Those of us who want to go south.<br/><br/>- What do you want to do? Vote on it?<br/>- Oh, forget the votes, Nolan.<br/><br/>And majority of rule, law and order.<br/><br/>There aren't any rules.<br/>There aren't any orders.<br/><br/>We can make any kind of world we like.<br/><br/>What are we arguing for?<br/>Let's get out of here.<br/><br/>All right. Mel, you and Otis get<br/>some food. We'll take all the cars.<br/><br/>- Peggy.<br/>- Yes?<br/><br/>- Take care of Lorna, will you?<br/>- Yes, I will.<br/><br/>It'll be daylight in about an hour or so.<br/><br/>Better all try and get some rest.<br/>We'll leave as soon as we can.<br/><br/>- I'll finish out the watch.<br/>- Let me help you with it.<br/><br/>- Suit yourself.<br/>- How about me?<br/><br/>You better stay with your wife. Oh, Mel, take<br/>that radio back in the storage room, will you?<br/><br/>Sure.<br/><br/>- Ready?<br/>- Mm-hmm.<br/><br/>Which side do you want?<br/><br/>- You take the back.<br/>- Anything you want, Professor.<br/><br/>Well, where is Jeff?<br/><br/>- What's the matter?<br/>- Well, he's tucked away safe enough.<br/><br/>We're leaving. They're going south.<br/>We're going north.<br/><br/>- No, we are not!<br/>- Oh, yes, we are.<br/><br/>- You haven't killed him, have you?<br/>- No, not yet.<br/><br/>One peep out of you, it could be arranged.<br/><br/>- Go to that car.<br/>- But I...<br/><br/>Oh, get on!<br/><br/>- You all right, Jeff?<br/>- I don't know.<br/><br/>Let's get you inside.<br/><br/>Ooh, my head.<br/><br/>Where do you think you're going?<br/><br/>You must get me a coat or a sweater.<br/>I'm absolutely freezing.<br/><br/>Stay in that car.<br/>I'll get you something further up.<br/><br/>Stay here.<br/><br/>Peggy!<br/><br/>Peggy!<br/><br/>Peggy.<br/><br/>Peggy.<br/><br/>Peggy! I have no time to play.<br/><br/>You're just making it rough on yourself.<br/><br/>- Ooh.<br/>- There. Almost as good as new.<br/><br/>- Ooh.<br/>- Thanks, Lorna.<br/><br/>Look, if you feel up to it,<br/>I think we ought to get out of here.<br/><br/>I'm going back to the village first.<br/><br/>But they're miles away by now.<br/><br/>There's a chance<br/>they might have stopped there.<br/><br/>Get everybody ready to go,<br/>and if I'm not back in 30 minutes...<br/><br/>leave without me.<br/><br/>Stay where you are! Stay!<br/><br/>What happened to Taggart?<br/><br/>He's gone.<br/><br/>It's a machine, a robot.<br/><br/>A few things begin to make sense.<br/><br/>Well, nothing makes any sense to me.<br/>What about them?<br/><br/>What are they? What did they want?<br/><br/>They're human slaves to these machines.<br/><br/>Violet was dead, wasn't she?<br/><br/>This must be some sort of a shock attack.<br/><br/>They paralyze all the bodily functions<br/>and then reactivate them.<br/><br/>Sightless and mindless slaves.<br/><br/>What would they do if they got away?<br/><br/>I don't know. Without any mind or any intelligence<br/>at all, uh, they'd be worse than animals.<br/><br/>We'd better be the ones that get away.<br/><br/>Come on.<br/><br/>We'd better go in.<br/><br/>What if they've left?<br/><br/>I told them to go without me<br/>if I wasn't back in a half hour.<br/><br/>Oh, thank God you've come. Lorna needs you.<br/><br/>- Jeff, I don't know what to do.<br/>- How is she?<br/><br/>- She's in a lot of pain.<br/>- Jeff, you'd better get in here.<br/><br/>- What can I do?<br/>- Come here.<br/><br/>Soon as the baby's born, we've gotta<br/>get out of here as fast as we can.<br/><br/>Mel, you and Otis drive<br/>down to the village...<br/><br/>and get everything<br/>you think a baby might need.<br/><br/>- Be as quick as you can, but be careful.<br/>- But, Jeff...<br/><br/>Relax, Mel. It isn't the first time<br/>this has happened.<br/><br/>Get me some safety pins. Get me some diapers.<br/><br/>Come on, Otis.<br/><br/>Oh, Jeff, I... I don't know anything<br/>about delivering a baby.<br/><br/>- You soon will.<br/>- I wish I had your confidence.<br/><br/>I do too.<br/><br/>- How is she?<br/>- Oh, she... she's coming along fine.<br/><br/>Oh. My goodness.<br/><br/>All that for one small baby.<br/><br/>You better keep it outside.<br/><br/>- Thanks for the help, Otis.<br/>- All right.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go back there...<br/>not for all the tea in China.<br/><br/>Well, we can't stay here. It isn't safe.<br/><br/>Well, she can't be moved.<br/><br/>- Where she goes, the baby goes too, you know.<br/>- I know. I know.<br/><br/>- She might be all right tomorrow.<br/>- Tonight is what I'm worried about.<br/><br/>- Well... did you meet your daughter?<br/>- Yeah. She snubbed me.<br/><br/>- Look, I don't know how to thank you.<br/>- Oh.<br/><br/>When I look at that baby,<br/>I should thank you for letting me help.<br/><br/>Hey, Jeff, did you see that thing in<br/>the village? It's some sort of machine.<br/><br/>Yeah. Yeah. We... We saw it.<br/><br/>- By the way, uh, where's Otis?<br/>- Oh, he turned chicken.<br/><br/>I think he's in the storeroom.<br/><br/>Otis.<br/><br/>Otis. Where...<br/><br/>Otis. Come on. Wake up.<br/><br/>Otis. Come on, boy. Up and at 'em!<br/><br/>- Dead drunk.<br/>- That's a great help.<br/><br/>Get the radio, Mel.<br/><br/>- I'll go check up on Lorna.<br/>- All right, Peggy.<br/><br/>You didn't get a chance to hear it, Mel, but<br/>that's the same sound that the robots give off.<br/><br/>You mean, you think they're<br/>being directed by a transmitter?<br/><br/>You see, our own space program has robot<br/>devices designed for use on the moon and Mars.<br/><br/>They'll telecast their findings<br/>back to us and send pictures.<br/><br/>They don't look like, uh, spacemen,<br/>but it's the same principle.<br/><br/>Yeah. But how could they land<br/>a transmitter here?<br/><br/>I don't think they did. I think<br/>they're using one of ours as a booster.<br/><br/>Phew.<br/><br/>If we could wreck it, we could put them<br/>out of commission... at least round here.<br/><br/>Without the beam they'd just be<br/>dead hunks of machinery.<br/><br/>That's right, if the, uh, theory's correct.<br/><br/>And how do we find the transmitter?<br/><br/>With this and a piece of copper wire.<br/><br/>Well, you better pick up that walkie-talkie<br/>so we can keep in touch with Peggy.<br/><br/>Sure.<br/><br/>When you reach the lowest volume...<br/><br/>the transmitter should be in a direct line<br/>with the plane of the antenna.<br/><br/>You take a reading and enter it on the map.<br/><br/>Then you drive a ways<br/>and take another reading.<br/><br/>Then a third about here.<br/><br/>Where the three lines intersect should be<br/>our transmitter. See how it's done?<br/><br/>Yes, it's the same way they used<br/>to track down amateur wireless sets...<br/><br/>- that were causing interference, isn't it?<br/>- That's right.<br/><br/>- Jeff.<br/>- Here. Let me have it.<br/><br/>- Jeff.<br/>- We've just taken the first reading.<br/><br/>Everything all right there? Over.<br/><br/>It's quiet as a tomb here. Lorna's sleeping.<br/>How long will you be, Jeff?<br/><br/>We'll be back as soon as we can.<br/>Over and out.<br/><br/>If my readings are correct,<br/>the transmitter should be down that road.<br/><br/>Well, what are we waiting for?<br/><br/>Jeff.<br/><br/>Jeff!<br/><br/>Jeff.<br/><br/>- Jeff.<br/>- Peggy. Peggy!<br/><br/>- The robots.<br/>- What?<br/><br/>Peggy!<br/><br/>Let it go.<br/><br/>Taggart!<br/><br/>- Oh, Jeff!<br/>- Peggy. Are you all right?<br/><br/>- Yes.<br/>- I don't understand how you stopped them.<br/><br/>We blew up the transmission tower. Without<br/>the signal they're just so much machinery.<br/><br/>Do you think it's safe now?<br/><br/>- Maybe there are other towers.<br/>- I don't know. Maybe there are.<br/><br/>But the main thing is we know how<br/>to stop them now, wherever they are.<br/><br/>Unless they try to use gas again.<br/><br/>There's always been that chance,<br/>and there always will be.<br/><br/>Let's see the baby. Come on.<br/><br/>Have you seen my baby daughter?<br/>She slept through everything.<br/><br/>She's a very important young lady.<br/><br/>All of a sudden people mean something again.<br/><br/>When can we leave? We might find a doctor.<br/><br/>As soon as you're up to it. We'll drive<br/>to the airport and take one of the planes.<br/><br/>Whatever people are left<br/>will see the plane and...<br/><br/>follow it south.</div>
