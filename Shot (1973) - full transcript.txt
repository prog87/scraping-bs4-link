Sure.<br/><br/>- Well, Mark.<br/><br/>It's my idea that me and my<br/>friends here...<br/><br/>Excuse me a minute, Mark.<br/><br/>Goddamn it, Micky!<br/><br/>If I told you once, I told you<br/>a thousand times,<br/><br/>not to fuck around when I'm trying<br/><br/>to make an important deal!<br/><br/>It's my idea that we take an<br/>extended vacation to Canada.<br/><br/>Just till things cool off.<br/><br/>- That sounds like a good idea.<br/><br/>- Mark, I'm gonna be upfront<br/>with you on this.<br/><br/>We need some bread.<br/><br/>And there's an opportunity for us<br/>to make a big score<br/><br/>on a beautiful investment if<br/>we have the backing.<br/><br/>It's a thousand percent winner.<br/><br/>- And you need some<br/>investment capital, huh?<br/><br/>- That's right, Mark.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful opportunity<br/>that just can't miss.<br/><br/>- What is it exactly?<br/><br/>- A fly in.<br/><br/>A big fly in of goodies<br/>that'll bring<br/><br/>a thousand percent profit.<br/><br/>- Come on, man.<br/><br/>It's not gonna work.<br/><br/>Look what happened the last time.<br/><br/>- Yes, it will.<br/><br/>Now, the last time was bungled.<br/><br/>I'll be the first to admit it.<br/><br/>But that's because it wasn't<br/>organized properly.<br/><br/>Me not being on the scene and all.<br/><br/>- That's right, he wasn't there.<br/><br/>- So what's gonna be<br/>different about this time?<br/><br/>- It's gonna be a drop,<br/>first of all.<br/><br/>None of this landing<br/>and takeoff crap.<br/><br/>And it's gonna be planned right.<br/><br/>We're gonna find a place<br/>that's secluded,<br/><br/>then we'll use radios.<br/><br/>You know, walkie-talkies.<br/><br/>We'll have guys watching the road<br/><br/>just in case the pigs come along.<br/><br/>Everything will be covered.<br/><br/>- Where's the drop gonna be?<br/><br/>- Out in the sticks.<br/><br/>Someplace where a plane<br/>can fly pretty low<br/><br/>without attracting attention.<br/><br/>- Who's gonna be your pilot?<br/><br/>The other guy's in jail.<br/><br/>- I got a guy I think<br/>will do all right.<br/><br/>- Yeah, he's just right.<br/><br/>- I'll tell you what.<br/><br/>I like those thousand<br/>percent returns.<br/><br/>So, if you can get a pilot,<br/>you can count me in.<br/><br/>- I think he'll do just fine.<br/><br/>- Yeah, unless he gets fried.<br/><br/>- Jimbo.<br/><br/>Hey, Jimbo.<br/><br/>How you doing, man?<br/><br/>- Shit, this goddamn place<br/>is a drag, man.<br/><br/>- Here, you better take this.<br/><br/>- Ooh, that's good.<br/><br/>The boss said you called.<br/><br/>We're not allowed to talk<br/>during working hours.<br/><br/>- Yeah, I just wanted to<br/>ask you something.<br/><br/>- What's that?<br/><br/>- I was wondering if you still had<br/>a pilot's license, man.<br/><br/>- Yeah, I still got it.<br/><br/>- Well, if you can get<br/>hold of a plane,<br/><br/>you might be able to<br/>earn some bread.<br/><br/>Like about 200.<br/><br/>- Yeah.<br/><br/>200.<br/><br/>- Only it's slightly illegal.<br/><br/>- Who the fuck cares?<br/><br/>- That's the right attitude, man.<br/><br/>Excuse me a minute.<br/><br/>Micky, put it down.<br/><br/>Good help's hard to<br/>find these days.<br/><br/>- That sounds good to me.<br/><br/>- Good, good.<br/><br/>And little Wanda here will be<br/>going along to help out.<br/><br/>- Yeah, good.<br/><br/>I'll take care of it.<br/><br/>Just let me know when you<br/>want me to do it.<br/><br/>But there's just one thing though.<br/><br/>- What's that?<br/><br/>- I don't want no fucking<br/>fried chicken around.<br/><br/>- Micky, put it down.<br/><br/>- 29er X-Ray to HQ.<br/><br/>- Go ahead, 29.<br/><br/>- 10-21 this number.<br/><br/>10-21 this number.<br/><br/>3-6-5-3-3-6-5.<br/><br/>365-3365.<br/><br/>- 10-4, 29er.<br/><br/>- Who's that to?<br/><br/>- Ruby.<br/><br/>I told her to meet me<br/>here at three.<br/><br/>- She didn't want to do<br/>much talking before.<br/><br/>What makes you think<br/>she'll talk now?<br/><br/>- Sometimes being arrested has a<br/>delayed effect on people.<br/><br/>It loosens the tongue.<br/><br/>Know what I mean?<br/><br/>- Ross, we busted that girl.<br/><br/>She hates our guts.<br/><br/>She's not gonna talk to you.<br/><br/>Headquarters to 29 X-ray.<br/><br/>- Yeah, go ahead.<br/><br/>- 29er, nobody<br/>answered on your 10-21.<br/><br/>- Okay, 10-4.<br/><br/>I wonder where the hell she is?<br/><br/>- Hey, did I tell you<br/>about the shoplifter<br/><br/>I caught last night?<br/><br/>She had a 12-pound turkey<br/>between her legs.<br/><br/>Not only that.<br/><br/>- Shut up.<br/><br/>There she is.<br/><br/>Hi.<br/><br/>You're right on time.<br/><br/>- I still don't like the<br/>idea of meeting<br/><br/>out in the open like this.<br/><br/>- This is unofficial.<br/><br/>- Unofficial?<br/><br/>- Well, semi-official.<br/><br/>- I don't think this is a<br/>very good idea.<br/><br/>I gotta go_<br/><br/>- Wait a minute.<br/><br/>It might be wise for you to talk<br/>to me for a minute.<br/><br/>- What about?<br/><br/>- About Little Don.<br/><br/>- What kind of shit are you<br/>trying to hand me?<br/><br/>- The only shit involved is<br/>what Little Don<br/><br/>had in the back of his van.<br/><br/>- Yeah, I remember.<br/><br/>Only, why should I want to tell<br/>you about Little Don?<br/><br/>- 'Cause if you don't,<br/><br/>I'm gonna rake your ass over<br/>the coals in court.<br/><br/>- Is that right?<br/><br/>- That's right.<br/><br/>Let's get in.<br/><br/>You drive.<br/><br/>- All right.<br/><br/>So what about the<br/>goddamn court date?<br/><br/>- You know, Ruby,<br/>sometimes I get the idea<br/><br/>that this here's the only<br/>real friend I got.<br/><br/>- What?<br/><br/>- YeP-<br/><br/>It's rough fighting<br/>crime all the time.<br/><br/>Day in, day out.<br/><br/>Nobody appreciates what you do.<br/><br/>Ain't that right, Wilson?<br/><br/>- Yeah, sure.<br/><br/>- That's not all.<br/><br/>Hell, just the other day the<br/>captain got all over my ass<br/><br/>about not having my hair out<br/>according to regulations.<br/><br/>Ain't that a bitch?<br/><br/>It's a dog's life.<br/><br/>This place is a pile of shit.<br/><br/>- Things are tough all over.<br/><br/>So what?<br/><br/>How about taking me home?<br/><br/>- Okay.<br/><br/>Got any of this stuff<br/>back at your place?<br/><br/>- Hey, come on, Ross.<br/><br/>We gotta 10-25 back to the station<br/><br/>and finish up that report on those<br/>two queers you beat up.<br/><br/>- Hey, fuck you.<br/><br/>I don't want to go back to<br/>the station now.<br/><br/>- Hey, look, goddamn it.<br/><br/>If you wouldn't make so much<br/>trouble all the time,<br/><br/>we wouldn't have to make out<br/>the fucking reports.<br/><br/>Shit, Captain Hayes wanted that<br/>thing two hours ago.<br/><br/>- Big deal.<br/><br/>Do it yourself.<br/><br/>My spelling's no good anyway.<br/><br/>- You're absolutely crazy.<br/><br/>You're really a fucking lunatic.<br/><br/>- Thanks.<br/><br/>- That's disgusting.<br/><br/>- You know, Ruby, you're<br/>really something.<br/><br/>You blow up your old man, then<br/>you get mad with me<br/><br/>'cause I happen to carry a gun.<br/><br/>- Oh, shit.<br/><br/>- Don't go.<br/><br/>- I'll be right back.<br/><br/>- You really think that hippie can<br/>fly a plane good enough?<br/><br/>- They let him rent one,<br/>didn't they?<br/><br/>How's everything look, Number Two?<br/><br/>Can you hear me okay, Number Two?<br/><br/>- Yeah, I hear you real good.<br/><br/>There's nobody around.<br/><br/>- Okay.<br/><br/>How's it look, Number Three?<br/><br/>- Looks good here.<br/><br/>- That's a pretty original code<br/>you're using there.<br/><br/>Number One, Number Two,<br/>Number Three.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's real tricky.<br/><br/>- Look, goddamn it.<br/><br/>You can't use names<br/>over these things.<br/><br/>It's a violation of the statutes.<br/><br/>- How about flying planes around<br/><br/>with big loads of dope in them?<br/><br/>- Don't worry about it.<br/><br/>Just get off my ass.<br/><br/>- All right.<br/><br/>What do I care?<br/><br/>- You just better care<br/>about this deal.<br/><br/>- Know where we are?<br/><br/>- Yeah.<br/><br/>If we follow that little<br/>road down there,<br/><br/>we should be all right.<br/><br/>- Hey, let's try out some of<br/>this stuff back here.<br/><br/>- Oh, no.<br/><br/>That's just not done<br/>while you're flying.<br/><br/>- Aw, come on.<br/><br/>It'll do you good.<br/><br/>Here.<br/><br/>- You know, it's funny.<br/><br/>You were with your old man when<br/>he got busted, right?<br/><br/>- I told you he's not my old man.<br/><br/>- Yeah.<br/><br/>Yeah, okay.<br/><br/>But you were there.<br/><br/>- That's right.<br/><br/>- Why didn't you get busted?<br/><br/>- Maybe I hid under the bed.<br/><br/>- Bullshit.<br/><br/>- Maybe they didn't think I was<br/>doing anything wrong.<br/><br/>- You better be sure you're not<br/><br/>doing anything wrong now, baby.<br/><br/>- Woo.<br/><br/>That's the El Dynamito.<br/><br/>- I told you it'd do you good.<br/><br/>- Yeah, sure did.<br/><br/>Wow, it sure is beautiful up here,<br/>isn't it?<br/><br/>- You know, I bet a couple<br/>pieces of fried chicken<br/><br/>would taste great right now.<br/><br/>- Ah, nothing could make that<br/>greasy crap look good.<br/><br/>- What's the matter?<br/><br/>- Nothing.<br/><br/>Shit, I was afraid I was lost<br/>there for a minute.<br/><br/>It's okay now though.<br/><br/>I gotta get a grip on myself.<br/><br/>- No, you don't.<br/><br/>Get a grip on this little devil.<br/><br/>- Good, good.<br/><br/>Do you hear that?<br/><br/>Oh, you goddamn dumb broad.<br/><br/>You don't even know what's<br/>going on, do you?<br/><br/>- We should be coming up on the<br/>spot pretty soon now.<br/><br/>- Want me to get<br/>this stuff ready?<br/><br/>- Yeah.<br/><br/>Yeah, we're almost there.<br/><br/>Goddamn, I feel funny.<br/><br/>Not bad, but kind of strange.<br/><br/>- This is Number One.<br/><br/>Chicken Boy is approaching.<br/><br/>I repeat,

drop.<br/><br/>- Okay, let it go now.<br/><br/>- Anything you say.<br/><br/>- Well, let's get the<br/>hell out of here,<br/><br/>get this thing parked,<br/>and get gone.<br/><br/>- Thought you were

Come on, let's get<br/>that stuff back.<br/><br/>- Did you ever see such a thing?<br/><br/>Fella shouldn't be allowed<br/>to fly an airplane<br/><br/>if he's gonna pull a<br/>stunt like that.<br/><br/>- Yeah, for sure.<br/><br/>- Hey, what is that stuff?<br/><br/>- Doesn't concern you.<br/><br/>- Oh, yes it does.<br/><br/>It concerns the sheriff, too.<br/><br/>- Listen, maybe you just better<br/>forget you seen us, Jack.<br/><br/>- My name ain't Jack and why<br/>should I forget I seen you?<br/><br/>- Because if you don't,<br/><br/>you ain't gonna be eating<br/>anymore hog jowls.<br/><br/>- Come on, goddamn it.<br/><br/>Let's get out of here before<br/>something else happens.<br/><br/>- What about this guy, man?<br/><br/>He's gonna run home and<br/>call the

definitely.<br/><br/>Very definitely.<br/><br/>Just to look at what the<br/>rehabilitation centers<br/><br/>like our Zodiac House have<br/>done is living proof<br/><br/>of what we have accomplished.<br/><br/>- Mr. Chambers, what do<br/>you feel the future goals<br/><br/>of the Zodiac House operation are?<br/><br/>- Well, there's kind of a<br/>dichotomy of terms here.<br/><br/>First of all, we've gotta<br/>think of the kids.<br/><br/>That's most important.<br/><br/>And if we can prevent a<br/>crime from happening,<br/><br/>maybe we can prevent arrests.<br/><br/>Prevention instead of detention.<br/><br/>- Hold it, man!<br/><br/>This is a private party!<br/><br/>Come on, stop!<br/><br/>- That stupid jerk.<br/><br/>- Well, Perry, let me put it like<br/>this plain and simple.<br/><br/>If we're going to<br/>stop the problem,<br/><br/>we've gotta get the<br/>pushers off the street<br/><br/>and stop the flow of drugs.<br/><br/>Excuse me.<br/><br/>Will you please
