Yeah, I'm okay.<br/><br/>No more...<br/>No more sharp knives, okay?<br/><br/>Copy that.<br/><br/>You know, when in doubt,<br/><br/>PB&amp;J is always a safer bet.<br/><br/>- Okay.<br/>- Okay.<br/><br/>Take good care of her, Herb.<br/><br/>Bye.<br/><br/>Hi.<br/><br/>Hey.<br/><br/>- Oh, do you want...<br/>- Yes.<br/><br/>How was...<br/><br/>How was your weekend?<br/><br/>It was good.<br/><br/>How was... how was yours?<br/><br/>Well, I had<br/>a near-death experience,<br/><br/>but, luckily,<br/><br/>I was rescued<br/><br/>by a very swift-moving,<br/>good doctor.<br/><br/>Looks like he did a good job.<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>You know what<br/><br/>when we met,<br/><br/>we.<br/><br/>Kind of hit it off.<br/><br/>And now things are very awkward,<br/><br/>and I just don't want<br/><br/>I don't want this<br/>to affect work and stuff.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>Thanks for inviting me<br/>to dinner.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Wow, this is amazing.<br/><br/>Well, it may be the boonies,<br/><br/>but we know how to live well.<br/><br/>What have you learned<br/>about our flagship store?<br/><br/>Uh, well<br/><br/>morale is incredibly low.<br/><br/>But there is<br/>this exceptional employee.<br/><br/>Her name is Maria Mercado.<br/><br/>She's<br/><br/>she's motivated,<br/><br/>she's responsible,<br/><br/>she's<br/><br/>honestly, everything you want<br/>in a store manager.<br/><br/>And<br/><br/>look, I know that<br/>Ted is your nephew...<br/><br/>Ted's an idiot,<br/><br/>but he's family.<br/><br/>We'll find<br/>something else for him.<br/><br/>Will all due respect, ma'am,<br/><br/>it's a much bigger issue<br/>than Cedar Falls.<br/><br/>When I walk into BuyRite,<br/><br/>back in San Francisco,<br/><br/>I feel like I'm walking back<br/>into the '80s.<br/><br/>The company needs<br/>a serious update.<br/><br/>It needs new systems,<br/><br/>new marketing,<br/><br/>it...<br/><br/>How did it get this bad?<br/><br/>My husband didn't always<br/>trust Buck very much.<br/><br/>But he respected Elizabeth.<br/><br/>She understood the business,<br/><br/>shared his desire<br/><br/>for Rhys and Nate<br/>to run it one day.<br/><br/>After she died,<br/><br/>it all fell apart.<br/><br/>Having the boys here helps,<br/><br/>but Nate is<br/><br/>like his dad.<br/><br/>He always does better<br/>if he has someone to...<br/><br/>Help him see the big picture?<br/><br/>It isn't always easy<br/><br/>meeting up<br/>to family expectations,<br/><br/>but<br/><br/>you and Nate<br/>would make an effective team.<br/><br/>If that's what you really want.<br/><br/>You wanted to see me?<br/><br/>I hear you've been helping<br/>Riley get the lay of the land.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, indeed.<br/><br/>She wants to learn<br/>as much as possible<br/><br/>about BuyRite.<br/><br/>Oh, I bet she does.<br/><br/>Now, listen.<br/><br/>I need you to do<br/>something for me.<br/><br/>If you deliver,<br/><br/>it could be good<br/>for the both of us, hmm?<br/><br/>Come on.<br/><br/>So, you want to go around Buck<br/><br/>and get Faye<br/>to approve your plans?<br/><br/>He is convinced<br/><br/>that I'm pretending to like Nate<br/><br/>so I can maneuver my way<br/>into the executive suite.<br/><br/>[Leila laughs]<br/><br/>Yeah, I know it looks like that,<br/><br/>but we both know it's not.<br/><br/>Where are you?<br/><br/>At the store.<br/><br/>The alarm went off.<br/><br/>Maria said that birds<br/><br/>have been triggering<br/>the sensor thing,<br/><br/>so I told Nate<br/>that I'd check it out.<br/><br/>You can come home, you know.<br/><br/>You don't have<br/>anything to prove.<br/><br/>No, that's not it.<br/><br/>I just need to prove to Faye<br/>that I know what I'm doing.<br/><br/>It's all locked up, Miss Smith.<br/><br/>Great.<br/><br/>Plus, once we get<br/>Cedar Falls up and running,<br/><br/>we can use it<br/>as a nation-wide model.<br/><br/>You know?<br/><br/>And this sales associate,<br/>Maria Mercado?<br/><br/>She's incredible.<br/><br/>She's young, she's dedicated.<br/><br/>She's the perfect image<br/>for the future of the company.<br/><br/>[thumping]<br/><br/>Maybe you should get behind me.<br/><br/>I... I gotta go.<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>[Maria] I feel awful about this.<br/><br/>Here you go.<br/><br/>Oh, gracias.<br/><br/>- Have a good night.<br/>- You too.<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>I started working at BuyRite<br/>since high school.<br/><br/>I was planning to go<br/>to community college,<br/><br/>but then I got pregnant<br/>with Amalia.<br/><br/>Did you take maternity leave?<br/><br/>We don't get maternity.<br/><br/>They said I could take<br/>two weeks unpaid.<br/><br/>- What?<br/>- Mm-hmm.<br/><br/>Any more than that,<br/><br/>they'd fire me.<br/><br/>So I took two weeks.<br/><br/>Do you have any, like,<br/>family that could help out, or?<br/><br/>Um, we'd been living<br/>with my mom,<br/><br/>but she died a few months ago.<br/><br/>I just couldn't keep up<br/>with rent,<br/><br/>so the landlord threw us out.<br/><br/>I just<br/><br/>I couldn't leave Amalia<br/>in a shelter while I worked.<br/><br/>Yeah, of course.<br/><br/>So we moved into the store.<br/><br/>And it never affected my job.<br/><br/>It never affected my job.<br/><br/>I had<br/>a really, really nice neighbor<br/><br/>who would watch her<br/>during the day.<br/><br/>And I would work overtime<br/>so I could close up.<br/><br/>Maria, have you ever<br/>thought about<br/><br/>you know,<br/>applying to be a manager?<br/><br/>You're so good.<br/><br/>It...<br/><br/>You just need a college degree.<br/><br/>Riley<br/><br/>I'm gonna share with you<br/><br/>what my mom's<br/>favorite saying was.<br/><br/>You can dress a goat in lace,<br/><br/>but you can't make a silk purse<br/>out of a sow's ear.<br/><br/>So, what she meant was<br/><br/>don't try and be something<br/>you're not, mi hija.<br/><br/>Don't aim too high.<br/><br/>I had such dreams for her.<br/><br/>I just never thought that<br/>we would end up like this.<br/><br/>Hi. Can you tell Rhys<br/>I need to talk to him ASAP?<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>[phone ringing]<br/><br/>Mom, Dad.<br/><br/>Hey, what's up?<br/><br/>You got married?<br/><br/>Uh, how did you hear that?<br/><br/>[Dad] Aunt Joan sent us a link.<br/><br/>She was living in the store?<br/><br/>- Why didn't you tell me?<br/>- [Mom] Why didn't you tell me?<br/><br/>Hold on one second.<br/>Rhys, I was going to...<br/><br/>[Dad] Oh, Riley, honey, wait.<br/><br/>Rhys!<br/><br/>Rhys! I...<br/><br/>[Mom] Where did she go?<br/><br/>[phone buzzes]<br/><br/>Hey.<br/><br/>How mad is she?<br/><br/>Remember when<br/>you built that volcano,<br/><br/>and Mom warned you<br/><br/>not to erupt it<br/>inside the house?<br/><br/>And ketchup sprayed<br/>all over the good carpet?<br/><br/>This is worse.<br/><br/>Much, much worse.<br/><br/>Dad, I was embarrassed<br/>when Beacon fell through.<br/><br/>I needed a job,<br/><br/>and Nate said<br/><br/>that it would be easier<br/>to bring me into the company<br/><br/>if we were married.<br/><br/>So you're just pretending?<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>It seemed like a good idea<br/>at the time.<br/><br/>And now<br/><br/>it is not working out<br/>the way I planned.<br/><br/>And I have no idea what to do.<br/><br/>Plus, his dad is looking for<br/>any way to fire me.<br/><br/>Riley,<br/><br/>I've never known you<br/>to back down from a fight.<br/><br/>Don't start now.<br/><br/>Thanks. Love you, Dad.<br/><br/>I love you, too, Riley.<br/><br/>No, I don't care<br/>what my father says.<br/><br/>We're not doing<br/>a stock buy-back.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>In all fairness to Buck,<br/><br/>a free month of Weight Watchers<br/><br/>with every plus-size swimsuit<br/><br/>was a good idea.<br/><br/>But we should've let customers<br/>sign up for it themselves.<br/><br/>You try to do something nice.<br/><br/>I had no idea<br/>she was living in the store.<br/><br/>She's a really good person<br/><br/>and she's great<br/>at what she does.<br/><br/>Let me handle it.<br/><br/>[Emily] ...It may not be enough<br/>to appease to satisfy customers.<br/><br/>To help deal with the fallout,<br/><br/>PR's brainstorming options<br/><br/>like having a brand ambassador<br/>do targeted press.<br/><br/>I would never do anything<br/>to harm this company.<br/><br/>Or this family.<br/><br/>I believe that.<br/><br/>[Emily] ...Plus-size options.<br/><br/>And with that,<br/>I hand it back to you, Buck.<br/><br/>BuyRite began<br/>as a family company.<br/><br/>Over the years,<br/>that family grew.<br/><br/>But it gets real complicated<br/><br/>when we open the door<br/>to someone who's not kin.<br/><br/>Now,<br/><br/>my father taught me<br/><br/>that the most important quality<br/>in an employee<br/><br/>is loyalty.<br/><br/>And it's because of that...<br/><br/>We'd like to acknowledge<br/><br/>the hard work and sacrifice<br/><br/>of all of you<br/><br/>who have kept<br/>this business going.<br/><br/>Mother...<br/><br/>It won't be easy<br/>to fix what's wrong.<br/><br/>But Buck and I have faith<br/><br/>in the next generation<br/>of Bynams.<br/><br/>Right now, Nate, Riley and Rhys<br/><br/>are polishing an ambitious plan.<br/><br/>And we look forward<br/>to unveiling it<br/><br/>at the next<br/>shareholders' meeting.<br/><br/>[Buck] Thank you all for coming.<br/><br/>That will be it for today.<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>What just happened?<br/><br/>I think we got tagged.<br/><br/>Okay<br/><br/>first thing we do<br/><br/>is we expedite<br/>the architectural plans.<br/><br/>Let's have them mock up<br/>a 3D rendering for Faye.<br/><br/>And you should talk to Emily.<br/><br/>We should run focus groups<br/>to improve customer service.<br/><br/>Rhys,<br/><br/>have Demarcus<br/>generate productivity reports<br/><br/>so we can expand the departments<br/><br/>that are yielding<br/>the highest revenue.<br/><br/>And then I will review<br/>the marketing analytics,<br/><br/>and then I'll get started<br/>on the mood boards<br/><br/>for the new aesthetic.<br/><br/>Well, I guess<br/>she's running point.<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>Okay, so this is just<br/>low-tech spitballing,<br/><br/>but based off<br/>of Emily's promotional ideas,<br/><br/>I kind of came up with<br/>some temp print ad ideas.<br/><br/>This...<br/><br/>These are really good.<br/><br/>This could work.<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>[Emily] Buck won't like it.<br/><br/>Yes, I know rebranding BuyRite<br/><br/>is like<br/>putting socks on a rooster.<br/><br/>You've been here too long.<br/><br/>[Emily] Damn, so have I.<br/><br/>Andrew must be worried sick.<br/><br/>Guess we should all head home.<br/><br/>[Riley] Well, actually, no.<br/><br/>Rhys and I have<br/>some budget stuff to go over,<br/><br/>so I'll just meet you.<br/><br/>All right, yeah.<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>Hey.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>You'll need<br/>a cost-benefit analysis<br/><br/>for that proposal.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>And... what's<br/><br/>what's this?<br/><br/>Oh, um,<br/><br/>Demarcus and I,<br/><br/>we mocked up<br/>a management training program.<br/><br/>You know, something<br/>employees can do<br/><br/>during their lunch break.<br/><br/>That's rather ambitious.<br/><br/>Yeah, well,<br/><br/>you know, shoot for the fences.<br/><br/>I'm so tired.<br/><br/>Can I show you something?<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>My mom created this<br/><br/>as a place for employees<br/>to escape after a long day.<br/><br/>I come up here to think a lot.<br/><br/>Smart woman.<br/><br/>It's quite the view.<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>Daniel used to teach me<br/>about the constellations.<br/><br/>I wish he was here.<br/><br/>But, you know, I think<br/>he'd be really proud<br/><br/>of what we're doing.<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>Look, Riley<br/><br/>I know you mean well,<br/><br/>but this company...<br/>It's a sinking ship.<br/><br/>You... you can't save it.<br/><br/>So what you've been doing<br/>is just humoring me?<br/><br/>No, I'm supporting you.<br/><br/>I just don't want to see you<br/>get your hopes up on this.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>Hmm.<br/><br/>You know, you can't<br/>shut the world out<br/><br/>just because<br/>things didn't work out<br/><br/>the way you planned, right?<br/><br/>I actually did<br/>my research on you,<br/><br/>and when you started<br/>your company,<br/><br/>the housing market<br/>was out of control,<br/><br/>so you bought old buildings<br/><br/>and you turned them<br/>into apartments<br/><br/>so that your employees could<br/>have more affordable housing.<br/><br/>That was<br/>purely a business decision.<br/><br/>Exactly.<br/><br/>Because you know good ethics<br/>makes for good business.<br/><br/>I'm assuming<br/>that your mom taught you that.<br/><br/>It is clear<br/><br/>that she put her heart and soul<br/>into this company,<br/><br/>and that is why you came back.<br/><br/>Would you want her<br/>to see you like this,<br/><br/>just counting down the days<br/>until you're done?<br/><br/>And pretending<br/>like you don't care<br/><br/>about<br/><br/>anything?<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>Riley?<br/><br/>Riley...<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>Oh, crap.<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>This all you got?<br/><br/>Well, I'm still working on it.<br/><br/>Well, work faster.<br/><br/>I want her outta here<br/>as soon as possible.<br/><br/>[singing]<br/>♪ Happy birthday to you<br/><br/>♪ Happy birthday, dear Mama<br/>♪ Auntie Faye<br/><br/>♪ Happy birthday to you<br/><br/>Thank you! It's beautiful.<br/><br/>Looks like you're gonna need<br/><br/>a bigger cake<br/>next year, Grandma.<br/><br/>There's a distinct possibility,<br/><br/>but as long as I'm still here,<br/><br/>I can cut my own cake.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>[Nate] Let me take<br/>the sparklers.<br/><br/>[Buck] Don't burn your fingers.<br/><br/>How about a big, old<br/>corner piece<br/><br/>for your favorite nephew?<br/><br/>You're my only nephew, Ted.<br/><br/>[Riley] Hey.<br/><br/>Did you think<br/>I wouldn't find out?<br/><br/>Uh, what?<br/><br/>You tricked<br/>Nate into marrying you.<br/><br/>You're just after his money.<br/><br/>[Riley] That's<br/><br/>that's not true.<br/><br/>I just don't get<br/>why he fell for it.<br/><br/>You're not exactly his type.<br/><br/>What's going on?<br/><br/>This little gold-digger...<br/><br/>She's not only flat-broke,<br/><br/>she's deep in debt.<br/><br/>Her folks<br/>don't even own their home.<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>Riley.<br/><br/>Riley...<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>Riley.<br/><br/>He's talking about my family.<br/><br/>Being in debt.<br/><br/>You know that I have<br/>an MBA from Stanford?<br/><br/>I have a degree from Berkeley,<br/><br/>and he's talking about me<br/>like I am trash.<br/><br/>This isn't about<br/>the money, Riley.<br/><br/>It's not about the money?<br/><br/>What are you talking about?<br/>Of course, it's about the money.<br/><br/>No. He's afraid of you.<br/><br/>[laughs] Okay.<br/><br/>Riley, he's afraid<br/><br/>that my grandma's<br/>going to like your ideas.<br/><br/>That... that the Board<br/><br/>is going<br/>to lose confidence in him<br/><br/>and force him out.<br/><br/>The Board thinks I am a nobody.<br/><br/>They don't care about<br/>what I have to say.<br/><br/>They don't care.<br/>They don't care!<br/><br/>They care, Riley, because<br/>you have a seat at the table.<br/><br/>As Nate's wife,<br/>you get a share of the company.<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>Look<br/><br/>the other night, I...<br/><br/>Yeah, I shouldn't<br/>have kissed you.<br/><br/>Sorry, I...<br/><br/>You're the only person<br/>since my mom<br/><br/>that can actually make a change.<br/><br/>We need you here.<br/><br/>I need you here.<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>Based on our most recent<br/>revenue reports,<br/><br/>we restructure<br/>the stores' layout,<br/><br/>making the most successful<br/>departments<br/><br/>the easiest to access.<br/><br/>We also rebranded<br/>the grocery department,<br/><br/>making it more modern<br/>and customer-friendly,<br/><br/>with a wide variety<br/>of fresh fruits and vegetables,<br/><br/>and also a designated area<br/>for ready-to-go meals<br/><br/>for our busy shoppers.<br/><br/>Another feature of our rebrand<br/><br/>is the reboot of our displays<br/>and our color palette.<br/><br/>You know, we want<br/>our customers to see<br/><br/>that there's been a real change<br/>here at BuyRite.<br/><br/>So, as you can see,<br/><br/>the most requested improvements<br/><br/>are flexible returns,<br/><br/>scan-and-go checkout,<br/><br/>and curbside pick-up.<br/><br/>But, at the end of the day,<br/><br/>BuyRite's biggest strength<br/>is our consumer loyalty.<br/><br/>Online surveys show<br/><br/>that 68% of customers<br/><br/>have been shopping at BuyRite<br/>for over 20 years.<br/><br/>So, as my mom always says,<br/><br/>in any good relationship,<br/><br/>it's important<br/>to spice things up,<br/><br/>remind them<br/>why they keep coming back.<br/><br/>Very nice.<br/><br/>[applause]<br/><br/>[Riley] And tomorrow,<br/>we'll walk through the store.<br/><br/>And behold our fabulous,<br/>new produce section.<br/><br/>Now, these new shelves<br/><br/>have bar code scanners<br/><br/>that gauge when supplies<br/>are running low,<br/><br/>then they notify the associates<br/>via an app on their phone.<br/><br/>Ted?<br/><br/>And when these changes<br/>go through,<br/><br/>these smart carts<br/><br/>will allow customers<br/>to upload their shopping lists.<br/><br/>The wireless system<br/><br/>tracks every item<br/>placed in the cart,<br/><br/>then allows customers<br/>to pay for it directly,<br/><br/>this reducing<br/>lines at check-out.<br/><br/>Plus, they recommend<br/>additional items<br/><br/>to customers,<br/><br/>which increases purchases<br/>by 20%.<br/><br/>[Emily] And to pay for it,<br/><br/>we've partnered with<br/>a number of national brands<br/><br/>whose products<br/>appear on the screen<br/><br/>as shoppers<br/>move down each aisle.<br/><br/>So we've updated our break room,<br/><br/>giving employees more reason<br/>to eat lunch there,<br/><br/>which increases productivity.<br/><br/>And we've expanded<br/>our management training,<br/><br/>creating the Elizabeth Fisher<br/>Scholarships,<br/><br/>so promising part-timers<br/>can finish college<br/><br/>and become team leaders.<br/><br/>And because we want<br/>our employees<br/><br/>to be able to take care<br/>of their families,<br/><br/>we're going to help subsidize<br/>the cost of daycare.<br/><br/>[Buck] We can't do that.<br/><br/>It'll bankrupt us.<br/><br/>Too much of our budget<br/>goes to recruiting new hires.<br/><br/>And research shows<br/><br/>that affordable childcare<br/><br/>results in<br/>lower employee turnover.<br/><br/>Very admirable.<br/><br/>Screw admirable.<br/><br/>Mama, do you have any idea<br/>how much that will cost?<br/><br/>Well, some of it will be offset<br/>by the free publicity we'll get.<br/><br/>Emily's put together<br/>a nationwide campaign.<br/><br/>Live Right, BuyRite.<br/><br/>[Riley] People want to feel good<br/><br/>about the purchases<br/>they're making,<br/><br/>and that loyalty<br/>is passed on to their children.<br/><br/>So you're really going<br/>to indulge them<br/><br/>in this bleeding-heart crap?<br/><br/>[Riley] Launching BuyRite<br/>required a big leap of faith.<br/><br/>And we are asking you<br/>to do that again...<br/><br/>Trust us to win over<br/>the trust of the new generation.<br/><br/>An excellent execution<br/>of a plan.<br/><br/>Well done, everyone!<br/><br/>[applause]<br/><br/>Uh-uh-uh-uh!<br/><br/>What the hell was that?<br/><br/>What? You didn't like it?<br/><br/>We agreed.<br/><br/>You were going to sabotage them.<br/><br/>I paid you plenty.<br/><br/>Yes, you did.<br/><br/>But Rhys paid me more.<br/><br/>[chuckles]<br/><br/>Oh, yeah?<br/><br/>Chip off the old block.<br/><br/>They loved it.<br/><br/>Oh, Riley, I'm so proud of you.<br/><br/>You haven't talked to Rhys yet?<br/><br/>I don't know<br/>if there's any point.<br/><br/>He's convinced himself<br/>he doesn't care.<br/><br/>But you think he does?<br/><br/>I know it sounds corny,<br/><br/>but I really do believe<br/><br/>that true love<br/>is your soul's recognition<br/><br/>of its counterpoint in another.<br/><br/>Emily Dickinson?<br/><br/>Wedding Crashers.<br/><br/>I should go.<br/><br/>Nate's taking me to dinner<br/>at the country club.<br/><br/>Oh!<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>- Try to have fun.<br/>- Yes.<br/><br/>Oh. Hey.<br/><br/>You're in love<br/>with my grandson, aren't you?<br/><br/>Just not the one<br/>you're married to.<br/><br/>Uh...<br/><br/>You do know that<br/>as long as you're with Nate,<br/><br/>he won't admit his feelings.<br/><br/>[♪♪♪]<br/><br/>You brought me as your guest<br/>to make Emily jealous, right?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>Really?<br/><br/>You didn't want<br/>to make her angry<br/><br/>so she'd come crawling back?<br/><br/>Okay, maybe,<br/><br/>but, look,<br/><br/>she doesn't love me anymore, so.<br/><br/>Are you sure about that?<br/><br/>Surprise!<br/><br/>[applause]<br/><br/>Wasn't me.<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>Rhys thought of it.<br/><br/>Since you never had<br/>a proper reception.<br/><br/>Enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Faye looks about as happy<br/>as a tick on a fat dog.<br/><br/>Come here.<br/><br/>- Oh.<br/>- Come on.<br/><br/>Well<br/><br/>there's no predictin'<br/><br/>whether this strategy of yours<br/>is gonna work nationwide.<br/><br/>Well, I guess<br/>we'll have to wait and see.<br/><br/>♪ ...What time it is<br/>I don't care ♪<br/><br/>♪ When you're runnin'<br/>your fingers through my hair ♪<br/><br/>♪ So let's let<br/>our love go on... ♪<br/><br/>Em.<br/><br/>[Winnie] Hey, you two!<br/>Say "flamingo"!<br/><br/>- Flamingo!<br/>- Flamingo!<br/><br/>[sobs happily]<br/><br/>You didn't have to do this.<br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>We are not done yet.<br/><br/>Mom! Dad!<br/><br/>- You guys are here!<br/>- Hi, sweetheart!<br/><br/>How are you?<br/><br/>Hi!<br/><br/>Um, this is...<br/><br/>Well, this is Nate.<br/><br/>- Oh! Hi, Nate!<br/>- Hi.<br/><br/>- Nice to meet you, Nate.<br/>- Nice to meet you, too.<br/><br/>[Riley] I'm... I.<br/><br/>I'm sorry<br/>that I didn't tell you.<br/><br/>I just...<br/><br/>You know, I didn't want you<br/>to be disappointed.<br/><br/>We're not disappointed,<br/>we're just surprised.<br/><br/>Me too. This is a surprise.<br/><br/>Rhys flew us first-class...<br/><br/>With fresh-baked cookies.<br/><br/>We wanted to join<br/>the mile-high club...<br/><br/>But we decided to wait<br/>till we got to the hotel.<br/><br/>[Mom] A suite, no less!<br/><br/>♪ With a Jacuzzi!<br/><br/>All those bubbles!<br/><br/>[Riley] Okay!<br/>Thank you for that.<br/><br/>Oh, I've missed<br/>our little chats.<br/><br/>Why don't I get us a drink?<br/><br/>- Yes.
