</script><br/><br/>Oh, it's so lovely! Hello?<br/><br/>Hi. What?<br/><br/>You're here? In Valleby?<br/>Now?<br/><br/>They're here in Valleby!<br/><br/>- Perfect. Don't accept anything, because<br/>a favour always has to be returned.<br/><br/>This is Tony with a y.<br/>- Open your mouth!<br/><br/>- Except tips, of course.<br/>It's disrespectful not to accept tips.<br/><br/>- Thanks.<br/>- Excellent coffee.<br/><br/>- This is Toni with an i.<br/>He spells it with—<br/><br/>- With—?<br/>- An I?<br/><br/>- Smart girl.<br/>- Dino!<br/><br/>- Godmother! Thank you for coming!<br/><br/>- It's all for the family.<br/>- This is my godmother Bresaola Panini.<br/><br/>- Hello.<br/>- What cute kids!<br/><br/>- You must be tired from your journey.<br/>Sit down, have something to eat.<br/><br/>- Dino!<br/><br/>Nice to see you!<br/>This is my brother, Pandoro Panini.<br/><br/>- Lasse.<br/>- Maja.<br/><br/>- How are things in Sicily?<br/>- A little noisy.<br/><br/>Since Clara Biscotti took over, they've started<br/>arguing about Stella Nostra again.<br/><br/>- But there's no quarrel here. Come on in.<br/>-Tony! Toni! Everyone!<br/><br/>- Brother? You don't look much alike.<br/><br/>Bresaola found him abandoned when he was little.<br/><br/>Now he's the—family's advisor and protector.<br/><br/>- What was he talking about? Stella Nostra?<br/>- The Biscotti family?<br/><br/>- My family's been—quarreling with<br/>the Biscotti family since—well, forever.<br/><br/>My great-great-grandfather Paolo<br/>was friends with Vito Biscotti.<br/><br/>One day when they were diving, they found<br/>a treasure chest with a huge diamond in it.<br/><br/>But who was going to keep it? Since then,<br/>the families have been enemies. There.<br/><br/>Stella Nostra.<br/><br/>The family that owns the diamond<br/>rules our village of Campione.<br/><br/>Here.<br/><br/>- Who has Stella Nostra now?<br/>- The Paninis.<br/><br/>- What happens if the Biscottis get the diamond?<br/>- There'll be war. But for now we're in Valleby.<br/><br/>- Dino!<br/>- Focaccia!<br/><br/>You've grown so much!<br/>- This is my sister Focaccia.<br/><br/>- Hello.<br/>- Hello. My name's Lasse.<br/><br/>- I know. See you!<br/><br/>- Come on!<br/>- Will you guys help with the food?<br/><br/>- Focaccia is so beautiful—<br/>So beautiful with such a big family.<br/><br/>Yes, a blue.<br/><br/>- Hello.<br/>- Hello, hi.<br/><br/>- Dino! Dino, hey! Yeah—<br/>The final's on Saturday.<br/><br/>The wedding just happens to be<br/>at the same time, so we could move—<br/><br/>Why's everyone looking so weird?<br/><br/>- They don't seem to like the police.<br/><br/>- What are the police doing here?<br/>We take care of everything within the family.<br/><br/>- Tell me if there's a problem,<br/>so Pandoro can fix it.<br/><br/>- No no no. Wait,<br/>the commissioner is my friend.<br/><br/>So don't touch him.<br/><br/>- Dino, we'll talk about it another time.<br/>Nice to meet you.<br/><br/>Th—think about it.<br/><br/>- Come on, Bresaola. Here.<br/><br/>Have something to eat now. Here's—<br/><br/>- Well, Dino, I've travelled<br/>all the way from Sicily<br/><br/>and still haven't met your future wife.<br/><br/>- She'll be here any minute.<br/><br/>Lassemaja, can you go to Needle<br/>&amp; Thread and check where Sara is?<br/><br/>What? Closed?<br/>- Weird.<br/><br/>- There she is.<br/>- Hey.<br/><br/>- Who are they?<br/>- More guests?<br/><br/>Sara!<br/>- Oh—hello.<br/><br/>- Is everything okay?<br/>- Yeah—really good.<br/><br/>- Who were they?<br/>- Who? Them? Well, well, they—<br/><br/>No idea. What're you doing here?<br/><br/>- Well, everyone's looking for you,<br/>wondering where you are.<br/><br/>- Sara, take it easy.<br/>What have you done?<br/><br/>- I tried to stop something.<br/>- What do you mean?<br/><br/>- Poor Dino. I didn't tell—<br/>He doesn't know who he's marrying.<br/><br/>If he finds out the truth, he<br/>won't want to get married.<br/><br/>- What are you talking about?<br/>Dino loves you. And you love him.<br/><br/>- Yes, with all my heart.<br/><br/>- Well then. You have to tell him.<br/>He'll understand.<br/><br/>- Do you really think so?<br/>- Yes of course. Come on now.<br/><br/>Dino!<br/>- Perfect!<br/><br/>- Dino—my Dino—<br/>- Come on, my darling.<br/><br/>- Dino—there's something I have to tell you.<br/><br/>- Come on. What is it?<br/>- Dino!<br/><br/>She's adorable!<br/>She looks almost Italian.<br/><br/>- Doesn't she?<br/><br/>- Hi. Is it true you're detectives?<br/>- What?<br/><br/>- Is it true you're detectives?<br/>- Well, yes.<br/><br/>- It sounds really cool.<br/><br/>- Now for the surprise!<br/>- Beloved Dino, beloved Sara<br/><br/>It is a great honour for me—<br/><br/>From the family, from the Paninis—<br/><br/>A present, a little, tiny little—<br/><br/>Well, maybe not so little—<br/><br/>For your wedding gift I give you—<br/><br/>Stella Nostra!<br/><br/>- Stella Nostra?<br/><br/>- That was my idea.<br/><br/>Now the Paninis and Biscottis won't<br/>have anything to argue about.<br/><br/>- Good thinking!<br/><br/>- Welcome to the Panini family, Sara Bernard.<br/><br/>- No—No, no, I really can't accept it.<br/><br/>- Yes, yes.<br/>- Not that. No.<br/><br/>- No!<br/>- Yes!<br/><br/>This is absolutely incredible!<br/><br/>- Dino. Dino, listen.<br/>- Yes, my darling?<br/><br/>- My mother's family comes from Sicily.<br/><br/>- But—so does mine!<br/><br/>- Yes. My godmother really wanted to come<br/>to the wedding. I tried to stop her—<br/><br/>But she's so determined.<br/>- Sara, everyone's welcome.<br/><br/>- Maybe we know her.<br/>- That's what I'm afraid of.<br/><br/>- So who is she then?<br/><br/>Clara Biscotti? She's Clara Biscotti?<br/><br/>Clara Biscotti.<br/><br/>- Well? What are you doing here?<br/>- My niece is getting married.<br/><br/>What are you doing here?<br/>- My godson is getting married.<br/><br/>- Dino?<br/><br/>Sara? Biscotti?<br/><br/>A double.<br/>- A double.<br/><br/>- I must say, I've never seen anything like it.<br/>Congratulations, Sara.<br/><br/>What a beautiful diamond. It seems<br/>Stella Nostra has finally found her way home.<br/><br/>- Another double.<br/>- Show me the gift that now belongs to us.<br/><br/>No, no, no.<br/>Don't even entertain the thought.<br/><br/>Sara, you forgot to<br/>tell me one small detail.<br/><br/>That youre going to marry a Panini.<br/><br/>- Oh no, not any more she's not.<br/><br/>- What?<br/>- What?<br/><br/>- Dino, sorry.<br/>You no longer have my blessing.<br/><br/>- Godmother—<br/><br/>- It's all my fault!<br/>- After her.<br/><br/>- Focaccia!<br/><br/>- It was stupid to bring the diamond.<br/>- You didn't know about Clara Biscotti.<br/><br/>- I still wish I hadn't brought it here.<br/><br/>- Yes, I've got it now! Focaccia, come on!<br/>I want to show you something. Come on!<br/><br/>- Now there's not going to be a wedding.<br/>- We've got time to come up with something.<br/><br/>Focaccia—What happens if you<br/>lock away the diamond till after the wedding?<br/><br/>- No diamond—<br/>- No trouble!<br/><br/>- What's this?<br/>- A wishing well. Come on.<br/><br/>Here. Throw it in and make a wish.<br/><br/>It works, I promise.<br/><br/>- Your turn.<br/>- My turn?<br/><br/>- It works, I promise.<br/><br/>- Okay.<br/><br/>Did it work?<br/>- Yeah!<br/><br/>- Do you know a good place<br/>to lock up the diamond?<br/><br/>- I know the perfect place!<br/>No, wait a minute.<br/><br/>Can you arrange it so Valleby win<br/>the Cup Final as well? Please!<br/><br/>- We have to hide Stella Nostra tonight.<br/>You go back to the others. I'll be there soon.<br/><br/>- But what are you going to do?<br/>- Go on, I'll be there soon.<br/><br/>Maja!<br/>- We have to find a way to save the wedding.<br/><br/>We know what to do.<br/>- We?<br/><br/>- Focaccia and me.<br/>- Good. What?<br/><br/>- Oh good, Focaccia!<br/>- Come on.<br/><br/>Good, Focaccia. Give me the diamond.<br/><br/>- No!<br/>- No, come here, my darling.<br/><br/>- No! None of you can have it.<br/>- We're locking it up until after the wedding.<br/><br/>- Lock up my diamond ?!<br/>- It stays there until you both agree.<br/><br/>- Agree? With that person?<br/>- That's never going to happen.<br/><br/>Well, where is this safe place?<br/>- In Muhammed Karat's jewellery shop.<br/><br/>- Is it really safe?<br/>-Absolutely safe. We promise.<br/><br/>- Okay, let's lock it up.<br/>- Wait!<br/><br/>How do we know the diamond's really in the box?<br/>You might be trying to trick me!<br/><br/>- You don't even trust a child?<br/>- I don't trust a Panini!<br/><br/>- So. One last look!<br/><br/>- Wait, may I take a closer look?<br/><br/>- Lasse, lock it up.<br/><br/>The diamond is safe.<br/>Ten centimeters of armour plate and an alarm.<br/><br/>And a single key that never leaves me.<br/><br/>- Agreed?<br/>- Agreed.<br/><br/>-Magpie.<br/>-Vixen.<br/><br/>... and the match. You owe me money!<br/>You have to pay your debts!<br/><br/>- Sara? Where's Dino?<br/>- They took him with them.<br/><br/>- What?<br/>- I didn't even have time to explain.<br/><br/>- But what about the wedding?<br/>- There won't be a wedding.<br/><br/>I knew it'd be like this.<br/>That's why I didn't tell anyone my name.<br/><br/>- You and Dino are perfect for each other.<br/>It's going to be all right!<br/><br/>- I really wish that was true, but—it's over.<br/><br/>A Panini and a Biscotti!<br/>What was I thinking?<br/><br/>Sara, don't cry.<br/><br/>You mustn't give up.<br/>You have to go on believing in love.<br/><br/>Love knows no obstacles.<br/><br/>Love doesn't care if your<br/>name is Biscotti or Panini.<br/><br/>Did I say something wrong?<br/><br/>No, Lasse.<br/><br/>You're right!<br/>- It'll be fine.<br/><br/>Just like for Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>- Lasse, you know<br/>what happened to Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>- Yes, they got each other.<br/>- No, Lasse. They died.<br/><br/>- What?<br/><br/>Muhammed Karat.<br/>- Please open your shop.<br/><br/>Lasse, Maja! We have to stop her!<br/><br/>She's going to get Stella Nostra!<br/>- Who? Why?<br/><br/>- Bresaola's room's been broken into.<br/>She thinks it was Clara Biscotti.<br/><br/>- Could Clara Biscotti have<br/><br/>- Was anything taken?<br/>- Nothing valuable, just some nail files.<br/><br/>Why would Clara steal nail files?<br/><br/>To tease us, and let us know she can.<br/><br/>- There you are.<br/>- Oh no!<br/><br/>- Don't, Bresaola! Please! I beg you!<br/>- That's enough now, Focaccia.<br/><br/>I'm taking Stella Nostra home today.<br/><br/>- But what about the wedding?<br/>- What wedding? Dino's coming home with me.<br/><br/>- Do something!<br/><br/>- There's actually nothing we can do.<br/>The Stella Nostra belongs to Bresaola.<br/><br/>- You said everything would work out!<br/><br/>- Focaccia!<br/>- Let her go. Come on.<br/><br/>So.<br/>-Mm.<br/><br/>Here.<br/><br/>That's it.<br/>-I want to see it.<br/><br/>- Yes of course.<br/><br/>There you are.<br/><br/>- What?<br/>- What?!<br/><br/>- What?<br/><br/>- But—this is impossible!<br/><br/>Clara Biscotti!<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>Commissioner?<br/><br/>Damp.<br/><br/>- But how could it just disappear?<br/>It was locked in.<br/><br/>Magic?<br/>- There's no such thing.<br/><br/>- But it's just vanished into thin air.<br/>The perfect crime.<br/><br/>- All criminals leave traces.<br/>You just have to find them.<br/><br/>- Found anything?<br/>- No. There's lots of fingerprints.<br/><br/>Even ours.<br/>- Not mine!<br/><br/>- Or—wait!<br/><br/>What's this?<br/><br/>Gunk?<br/>- Gunk? Good, Maja. All criminals leave traces.<br/><br/>- The burglary and the theft must be connected.<br/>- Yes, we have to examine her room.<br/><br/>Why are they dragging in all the mattresses?<br/><br/>- Oh dear. That's really not good.<br/>- Why not?<br/><br/>- It means they're preparing for war.<br/>- Panini vs. Biscotti?<br/><br/>A family war in the middle of Valleby?<br/>- LasseMaja, don't turn round. It's me, Sara.<br/><br/>I have to talk to Dino.<br/>Can you give him this if you see him?<br/><br/>I miss him.<br/>- We'll do everything we can.<br/><br/>Okay, we have to get into the house.<br/><br/>Hey, what are you doing?<br/><br/>- We want to talk to Tony.<br/>-Wit an y?<br/><br/>-Wit a i?<br/><br/>- Toni with—<br/>- With—?<br/><br/>- Wit a i!<br/>- Clever girl.<br/><br/>- Pandoro told us to help.<br/> So you can go and eat.<br/><br/>- Food? I was just thinking about that.<br/>- Were you? Strange, me too.<br/><br/>How dare Clara humiliate me?<br/><br/>First she steals Stella Nostra<br/>and then she messes up my room!<br/><br/>- She doesn't know who she's dealing with.<br/><br/>No sign of a break-in.<br/>- No damage to the door.<br/><br/>Look what I've found!<br/><br/>The missing nail files. Wet.<br/><br/>Gunk! Same as at the safe.<br/><br/>- What's that? Clay? Here too?<br/><br/>- What are you doing here?<br/>- The diamond has something to do with the burglary.<br/><br/>- You have to get out of here!<br/><br/>You don't know what they'll<br/>do if they find you here!<br/><br/>- Hurry up! Give the letter to Dino.<br/>It's from Sara.<br/><br/>- All for love. Go now!<br/><br/>More mattresses?<br/><br/>Stop there!<br/><br/>- We need to talk to Clara.<br/>- What about?<br/><br/>- Stella Nostra.<br/><br/>- Follow me.<br/><br/>- I haven't ordered any break-in<br/>at Bresaola's, nor of the safe.<br/><br/>Why would I do that?<br/>- Because you had the opportunity.<br/><br/>- If I'd got Stella Nostra<br/>I wouldn't be here now.<br/><br/>- Do you have any idea who has it?<br/><br/>I thought they were the detectives. Yes?<br/><br/>And that it's your job to solve such things.<br/><br/>But if you ask me—because you are, aren't you?<br/>They're asking me now—yes, exactly.<br/><br/>I think the vixen herself did this and<br/>she's trying to put the blame on me.<br/><br/>- There's nothing to suggest that.<br/>- But we have found something else.<br/><br/>Can we see your soles?<br/>- My what?<br/><br/>- The soles of your shoes.<br/><br/>- My shoes—?<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>- Okay, can we see their shoes too?<br/><br/>- What are you looking for?<br/>-We found gray gunk.<br/><br/>Grey gunk on the shoes?<br/>- Exactly<br/><br/>- Look at the kid's shoes.<br/><br/>- You mean the kind of gunk<br/>that's on your shoes?<br/><br/>- Lasse!<br/>- I don't know.<br/><br/>Clara Biscotti! Come out if you dare!<br/><br/>You'll get one last chance,<br/>Clara Biscotti, but only one.<br/><br/>Give me back Stella Nostra!<br/>- Or else?<br/><br/>- Or else it's war.<br/>- I don't have Stella Nostra.<br/><br/>But I know who does.<br/><br/>They've got it.<br/>- The kids?<br/><br/>-Yes—the thieves.<br/>- Thieves? Us?<br/><br/>- The kids found gray gunk<br/>near the safe and in your room.<br/><br/>- Yes, and?<br/><br/>- And was it not the case—and do<br/>feel free to correct me—<br/><br/>Was it not the case that<br/>it was Lasse and Maja—<br/><br/>who suggested Muhammad Karat's<br/>safe as a secure place?<br/><br/>And wasn't it Lasse and Maja who took<br/>such good care of Muhammad Karat?<br/><br/>Muhammad—who's the one who<br/>keeps the only key to the safe.<br/><br/>Isn't that how it was?<br/>- Bravo.<br/><br/>- We didn't take the diamond! I swear!<br/><br/>- We'll take care of them.<br/>Pandoro can persuade people to talk.<br/><br/>- You're too funny, Bresaola.<br/>You don't think I'm giving you them, do you?<br/><br/>Grissini, do what you have to do.<br/>- Let me go, you baboon!<br/><br/>- Wait, Bresaola! What's happening?<br/>- Clara's stealing the thieves.<br/><br/>- Thieves? Are you crazy?<br/>They're innocent!<br/><br/>- What are we doing here then?<br/>- Nothing.<br/><br/>- You, release the children immediately.<br/>- They're the ones who stole it.<br/><br/>Everything suggests it.<br/>- I have a hard time believing that.<br/><br/>- Can we see the sole of his shoe?<br/>Show us the gunk.<br/><br/>- Yes, sure, sure.<br/>- You see?<br/><br/>Lasse, it's the same gunk as—<br/><br/>Although there are traces<br/>that point to Lasse and Maja—<br/><br/>We need to do this at the station.<br/>Let go of the children!<br/><br/>- That's it.<br/>- They're innocent!<br/><br/>- Unfortunately, it looks bad.<br/>- You'll have to come to the station.<br/><br/>I'm sorry.<br/>- Me too.<br/><br/>- What for?<br/>- For this.<br/><br/>- Get after them!<br/><br/>This way!<br/><br/>That way!<br/><br/>Where are they?<br/><br/>Here, follow me!<br/><br/>There's no one here!<br/><br/>Find them and bring them here. Alive.<br/><br/>Come on now, guys!<br/><br/>- They're coming!<br/><br/>They're everywhere!<br/>They're going to find us any moment!<br/><br/>- Maja, how could it have come to this?<br/>- I don't know.<br/><br/>- We can't stay here.<br/>- We have to get out of Valleby.<br/><br/>- Yeah. But how?<br/><br/>- We can go by train.<br/>- No. I'll never, ever, ever ride that train.<br/><br/>- Looks like we don't have a choice. Come on!<br/><br/>That's where we're going!<br/>- No!<br/><br/>- There they are! After them, Tony!<br/><br/>- What now then?<br/>- We're going to the other side.<br/><br/>- Maja—we're not going to jump, are we?<br/><br/>You won't get away!<br/><br/>- We'll use a tightrope.<br/>- Not on your life!<br/><br/>They're coming! Go! We're going by train!<br/><br/>- You're probably used to this.<br/><br/>- No, this is the first time.<br/>-Come down, it's dangerous!<br/><br/>- Don't think you're getting away.<br/>- Watch out!<br/><br/>- No no no!<br/><br/>- Come down from there!<br/>- Tony, what're you doing with the kids?<br/><br/>Shake the line and they'll come back.<br/><br/>Look out!<br/><br/>- Hello!<br/>- But—what—?<br/><br/>- No!<br/>- Don't just stand there! Go, go, go!<br/><br/>Yes Yes.<br/><br/>This way!<br/><br/>Where are they?<br/><br/>Come on! Where did they go?<br/><br/>Where! There they are!<br/><br/>What're you doing? After, after, after!<br/>After them!<br/><br/>Halt!<br/><br/>Stop!<br/><br/>- Now we've got you!<br/>-There!<br/><br/>- Now we've got you!<br/>- Maja!<br/><br/>- Here!<br/>- After them!<br/><br/>Other side!<br/><br/>I never thought we'd be on the run.<br/><br/>- Neither did I.<br/>- It's dangerous to steal from the mafia.<br/><br/>- Yeah, especially if you didn't do it.<br/>And you're the only suspect.<br/><br/>- I know.<br/><br/>- What have you got on your shoe anyway?<br/><br/>It's hard. Cement?<br/><br/>Have you been on a construction site?<br/>- No.<br/><br/>Actually—yes. The Wishing Well.<br/>They're rebuilding it, so it was closed.<br/><br/>- How do you know that?<br/>- We were there. Me and—<br/><br/>- Focaccia?<br/><br/>- But why didn't you say anything?<br/>- It didn't seem important.<br/><br/>- Not important?<br/><br/>We're looking for someone with cement<br/>on the soles of their shoes—<br/><br/>and now you tell me you<br/>were there with Focaccia?<br/><br/>- It doesn't sound so good now.<br/>I don't know why I didn't say anything.<br/><br/>Because you're in love, of course!<br/><br/>In love? Me?<br/><br/>In love?<br/>- You weren't thinking clearly.<br/><br/>The case is starting to get personal for you.<br/>- Maja? You have to help me fall out of love.<br/><br/>- Sorry, Lasse, you can't<br/>help anyone fall out of love.<br/><br/>The cement's probably a red herring.<br/><br/>Focaccia must have cement on her shoes too.<br/>- Yeah—<br/><br/>- That doesn't make her guilty.<br/>- True. But we did see the diamond get locked away.<br/><br/>- Yeah but by morning it was gone.<br/>How could it have disappeared?<br/><br/>- I don't know.<br/>- We must have missed something.<br/><br/>- We have to get back to the safe.<br/>- Come on.<br/><br/>Okay. See anything?<br/><br/>- It's blocked.<br/><br/>How're we going to get in?<br/>- I don't know.<br/><br/>The commissioner!<br/><br/>We're wanted!<br/>- What?<br/><br/>There are people everywhere.<br/>We can't even go over the roofs.<br/><br/>We have to find another way.<br/><br/>I think I have an idea.<br/><br/>We have to trick them so they go away.<br/><br/>- You got an idea?<br/><br/>-Spades—<br/>- Hve you got something, or—<br/><br/>- What?<br/>- Go away. Buzz off!<br/><br/>- Are you Tony?<br/>-With y or i?<br/><br/>- We have a message for you.<br/>- From someone named Pandoro.<br/><br/>- Pandoro? But why did he send you?<br/>- We don't know.<br/><br/>But we got 500 kronor to take<br/>a message to Tony with a y and a i.<br/><br/>- OK, so let's have it then.<br/><br/>"Lasse and Maja are at the train station.<br/>All the men to go there."<br/><br/>- That's us.<br/><br/>- And Tony! It's very urgent.<br/>-Yes, yes.<br/><br/>- Hello!<br/>- Hello. Is it just you two?<br/><br/>How did you get past the guards?<br/>- We tricked them into leaving.<br/><br/>- But they're gonna be back.<br/>- We need your help.<br/><br/>-Yeah—they think I gave you the key.<br/>I'll have a problem if they find you here.<br/><br/>- You don't think we stole the diamond, do you?<br/>- No! You're not thieves.<br/><br/>What can I do to help?<br/>- We have to look at the safe.<br/><br/>- Okay. Come on.<br/><br/>- Hello.<br/>- Hold it there, Tony!<br/><br/>What're you doing?<br/>- We're on our way to the station.<br/><br/>- You're supposed to be guarding the jewellery shop.<br/>- But you sent us a message.<br/><br/>- What message?<br/><br/>- That Lasse and Maja are at the station.<br/>- I have twelve men at the station.<br/><br/>Why would I want you there?<br/>- But you sent us a message about it.<br/><br/>- I didn't send any message.<br/>Wait a minute—who's guarding the shop?<br/><br/>-No one, I think.<br/>- And who delivered the message?<br/><br/>- It was two children.<br/>- Now you come with me!<br/><br/>That's right.<br/><br/>- How did the thief get the diamond out of the safe?<br/><br/>- It's gone up in smoke, as the commissioner said.<br/>- Listen.<br/><br/>I haven't dared say anything.<br/>Why does anyone even want the thing we locked away?<br/><br/>- What? What do you mean?<br/>- It's a giant diamond.<br/><br/>- Let me see that.<br/><br/>Yes, just as I thought. If that's<br/>a diamond, I'm a skating princess.<br/><br/>- So is Stella Nostra a fake?<br/>- I don't know anything about Stella Nostra.<br/><br/>But that's not a diamond. It's a fughesi.<br/>- A fughesi?<br/><br/>- A fake?<br/>- A phony ?<br/><br/>- But how can you tell?<br/>- The light. The light, Lasse.<br/><br/>There. Swiss diamond spotlights.<br/><br/>They produce maximum reflection<br/>in the diamond's facets.<br/><br/>- Yeah!<br/>The diamond in the box didn't sparkle at all!<br/><br/>- But the one Sara got dazzled me.<br/>- Yeah, me too!<br/><br/>- That means it was real.<br/><br/>- So what was it we locked in the safe?<br/>- It could have been anything.<br/><br/>- Pandoro!<br/>- I can hold him up.<br/><br/>Open up!<br/><br/>Open the door!<br/><br/>- OK Lasse—what could look like a diamond? Glass?<br/><br/>Lasse! We have to think fast!<br/>Muhammad's a lousy liar. We'll get caught!<br/><br/>I didn't think about it at the time,<br/>but the box was wet. Water!<br/><br/>- Water!<br/>- Ice!<br/><br/>- The diamond didn't go up in smoke,<br/>it melted and turned into water!<br/><br/>- Hello.<br/>-Where are they? We know they're here.<br/><br/>Best to tell the truth.<br/>-Otherwise we'll make—<br/><br/>fishcakes out of you!<br/>- They're not here!<br/><br/>You have one last chance<br/>to tell us where they are.<br/><br/>Or we'll all take a little boat trip.<br/>- Yeah, yea—<br/><br/>- Hello!<br/>- Look, there they are.<br/><br/>- Tony!<br/>- With a y? Or i?<br/><br/>- After them!<br/><br/>They were here a moment ago.<br/><br/>- We'll take the jeweller instead.<br/><br/>Wait until Bresaola hears about this.<br/><br/>Okay, what do we have?<br/>- What we have is a fake diamond made of ice.<br/><br/>And a real one that's disappeared.<br/>- And Bresaola's nail files were wet.<br/><br/>What's the connection?<br/><br/>- How do you turn an ice cube into a diamond?<br/>- You file it—with a nail file!<br/><br/>But with single-use files,<br/>you need quite a lot.<br/><br/>So she'd have to use several<br/>before she was finished.<br/><br/>- You have to be good at filing.<br/>- And have easy access to Bresaola's room.<br/><br/>But who would dare to steal from the mafia?<br/>Someone who—belongs to the mafia.<br/><br/>- Someone with cement on their shoes.<br/><br/>Who left traces at the safe<br/>and in Bresaola's room.<br/><br/>- Focaccia.<br/>- Unfortunately, everything points to her.<br/><br/>- No diamond, no trouble.<br/>- What?<br/><br/>- You're right. Focaccia didn't care about<br/>the diamond. She just wanted peace and quiet.<br/><br/>That's why we went to—the wishing well!<br/><br/>- We have to hide Stella Nostra tonight.<br/>You go back to the others. I'll be there soon.<br/><br/>- But what are you going to do?<br/>- Go on, I'll be there soon.<br/><br/>She never said what she was going to do.<br/>Now I understand!<br/><br/>She went to Bresaola's room.<br/>- She must have got the idea for the switch then.<br/><br/>She only needed to grind an ice cube into a diamond.<br/><br/>She knew about the nail files in Bresaola's room.<br/><br/>She must have switched Stella Nostra<br/>on the way to the safe.<br/><br/>- Her dress!<br/>- Her dress?<br/><br/>- The ice cube must have soaked Focaccia's dress.<br/><br/>Because when she came back she'd changed.<br/><br/>- But—where's the real Stella Nostra?<br/><br/>I don't know. We need to talk to Focaccia.<br/><br/>Come on. She's the only one who<br/>can prove we're innocent.<br/><br/>- If we find the dress, we can probably<br/>prove that she filed down the ice cube.<br/><br/>Guards everywhere!<br/><br/>Maybe we should wait a bit.<br/>Until things calm down.<br/><br/>- Yes, take the chance to get some sleep.<br/><br/>Dear Dino. I'm so sorry things have<br/>turned out the way they have.<br/><br/>But I hope there will be a future for us.<br/><br/>I miss you so much.<br/><br/>Your Sara.<br/><br/>Clara. Do sit down.<br/>- Yes.<br/><br/>- I have a suggestion.<br/>- Yes?<br/><br/>- A war could be quite costly for both of us.<br/>- Yes indeed.<br/><br/>So what do you say, shall we co-operate?<br/><br/>Lasse and Maja are our common enemy.<br/><br/>And I have an idea how to catch them.<br/><br/>Like this ...<br/><br/>Where is everyone?<br/>- They're sleeping, I suppose.<br/><br/>Look—Focaccia's window's open.<br/><br/>And there's a ladder.<br/><br/>This doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>Focaccia!<br/>- Lasse! This is all wrong. We have to go back!<br/><br/>- Not until we find Focaccia.<br/>- She's not here.<br/><br/>- Wait. Focaccia!<br/><br/>- The dress!<br/><br/>Wet! Look what I've found!<br/><br/>- And look what I've found!<br/>I knew I'd find you here sooner or later.<br/><br/>Don't you think I noticed that<br/>you're interested in Focaccia?<br/><br/>- This time you won't get away.<br/>I'll personally make sure of that.<br/><br/>- Wait, wait!<br/><br/>If you tell me where you've hidden Focaccia,<br/>then maybe I can help you.<br/><br/>- Focaccia's gone?<br/>- "Focaccia gone?"<br/><br/>Tell me now. Otherwise—Pandoro's<br/>so fantastically good with children.<br/><br/>Focaccia means a lot to me.<br/><br/>- Where is she?<br/><br/>- We didn't know she was gone.<br/>- We came here looking for her.<br/><br/>I promise!<br/><br/>- That's a shame. A great shame.<br/><br/>Yes, yes, you had your chance.<br/><br/>Clara? Hi. It's Bresaola.<br/><br/>Guess what? I've found a pair<br/>of little rats with us here.<br/><br/>Do you think your Grissini would like<br/>to play with my Pandoro?<br/><br/>I think they'd have so much fun.<br/><br/>Just send him over. Yes that's fine.<br/><br/>Entertain the rats for a bit.<br/>I'll go and meet Grissini.<br/><br/>- Can we—?<br/>- Save a little for me.<br/><br/>Should we skip the marinade<br/>and go straight to the barbecue?<br/><br/>WISHING WELL OPENS TODAY<br/><br/>Thank you for showing me the wishing well.<br/>Hope it fulfills my wish.<br/><br/>What did you wish?<br/><br/>I know where Focaccia is.<br/>-What?<br/><br/>She's at the wishing well. She must be.<br/><br/>Pandoro! If you let us go<br/>we can show you where Focaccia is!<br/><br/>- Focaccia? What's he going on about?<br/>- These rats kidnapped Focaccia.<br/><br/>- Kidnapped a child? A child?<br/>That's absolutely the worst I've ever heard!<br/><br/>- What do you think?<br/>Should we let them sleep with the fishes?<br/><br/>- Will you please listen?<br/><br/>- We have to find Focaccia!<br/><br/>And we will.<br/>But first we'll have some fun.<br/><br/>-I'll mix the cement.<br/>-Okay, Maja, now we have to think fast!<br/><br/>- I've got something that'll<br/>keep them warm. Come and look.<br/><br/>Hold out your hand.<br/><br/>- I have to pee.<br/>- Well, you'll have to pee on yourself.<br/><br/>- Here? On the chair?!<br/>- No—<br/><br/>- No?<br/><br/>- Yes.<br/><br/>- Go on.<br/>- I can't pee if you're watching.<br/><br/>You'll have to turn round.<br/><br/>- Are you nearly done?<br/><br/>How much have you had to drink!<br/>Have you emptied an entire well?<br/><br/>- Now I need to pee.<br/>- Me too.<br/><br/>- Finished!<br/>- No!<br/><br/>- No, no, wait!<br/>- Come back, do you hear—<br/><br/>- Where are the kids?<br/>- The kids—well, they were here—<br/><br/>- But now they're down there.<br/>- Run!<br/><br/>This way! Commissioner! Great to see you!<br/><br/>- Lasse and Maja—<br/><br/>- We know how the burglary was done!<br/>- And who took Stella Nostra!<br/><br/>- Good, good, but listen to me.<br/><br/>You can't hide any longer.<br/>Come on with me to the station.<br/><br/>- We can't do that!<br/>- We're innocent!<br/><br/>- We can prove it.<br/>- That's why you should come to the station. Come on.<br/><br/>- We have to save Focaccia!<br/>- They should be here.<br/><br/>- They're coming!<br/><br/>- I heard Lasse and Maja here. Where are they?<br/><br/>The water's being turned on in six minutes!<br/>- The bucket's down.<br/><br/>She may have climbed down into the well.<br/>- Yes!<br/><br/>- Stella Nostra's down there!<br/>- Yes!<br/><br/>- Focaccia!<br/>-She may not be here.<br/><br/>- She must be. Focaccia! Can you hear me?<br/>- She might be somewhere else.<br/><br/>- No. Focaccia!<br/>- Lasse!<br/><br/>- Focaccia! She's here!<br/>- Lasse! Help!<br/><br/>- I knew it! Where are you? I can't see you!<br/>- I'm stuck !!<br/><br/>- Okay. We'll help you up!<br/><br/>- Yes? Commissioner here.<br/><br/>- It's Maja.<br/>- Hello Maja!<br/><br/>- We've found Focaccia.<br/>-Focaccia? In the wishing well?<br/><br/>-The water's being turned on in five minutes!<br/>- Five minutes!<br/><br/>- Quick!<br/>- I'm on my way!<br/><br/>-What about Focaccia?<br/>-She's stuck in the wishing well.<br/><br/>Follow me!<br/><br/>- Bresaola.<br/>- Clara.<br/><br/>Hello? What? The wishing well?<br/><br/>Hurry!<br/><br/>Ready?<br/>- Ready.<br/><br/>Focaccia! Where are you?<br/>I can't see you.<br/><br/>Focaccia!<br/>- I knew you'd come.<br/><br/>- How did you end up here?<br/><br/>- I thought a diamond could fulfill lots of<br/>wishes, so I threw it down here.<br/><br/>Then when they said you were the thieves,<br/>I wanted to get it back again.<br/><br/>- But then I couldn't get out.<br/>- Come on, quick!<br/><br/>- How's it going? Hurry!<br/><br/>No!<br/>- Water!<br/><br/>- We have to hurry!<br/>- What're you doing?<br/><br/>- Can you walk?<br/>- No, I can't, I can't climb.<br/><br/>- Jump up!<br/>- Grab the bucket!<br/><br/>- Ready?<br/>- Maja, crank up Focaccia!<br/><br/>Maja, hurry up!<br/><br/>The bucket's coming down now!<br/><br/>Okay!<br/><br/>- Lasse, the diamond!<br/><br/>- Wait!<br/><br/>Lasse!<br/><br/>Focaccia 's over there!<br/><br/>- Stop!!<br/><br/>But—<br/><br/>Turn it off, I said!<br/><br/>Help me!<br/><br/>Lasse!<br/><br/>Right at the last moment. Well done!<br/><br/>Focaccia. I've got it!<br/><br/>- Focaccia!<br/><br/>- Bresaola!<br/>- Where have you been?<br/><br/>You'll pay dearly for this.<br/>Kidnapping a child! You should be ashamed!<br/><br/>Pandoro, get them.<br/>- No, no, no! It's not what it looks like.<br/><br/>Lasse and Maja saved my life.<br/>- It's true.<br/><br/>- It was me who stole Stella Nostra.<br/><br/>- Where did you get that from?<br/>- Sorry, Bresaola.<br/><br/>I broke into your room and stole your nail files.<br/>- You!<br/><br/>So it wasn't Lasse and Maja?<br/>- The opposite, they saved me.<br/><br/>I'd have drowned without them.<br/>- But how—<br/><br/>It was all you?<br/>- Yes, I wanted to end the quarrel.<br/><br/>So—what do we do with Stella Nostra?<br/>- I'll take it.<br/><br/>-I'll take it.<br/>- No no, I can take it—<br/><br/>- Stop stop stop! Don't start that again!<br/>Can't you stick to the plan?<br/><br/>- Don't you have something to sort out?<br/>- There are actually more important people.<br/><br/>Well?<br/><br/>What do we have to sort out?<br/>- Search me—<br/><br/>Sara!<br/><br/>Sara!<br/>- Dino?<br/><br/>- Sara?<br/>- Dino? Is that you, Dino?<br/><br/>Sara! Oh, Sara, I've been longing for you.<br/><br/>- And I for you! I didn't think<br/>you wanted to be with a Biscotti.<br/><br/>- I don't care that you're a Biscotti.<br/>The only thing I care about is you.<br/><br/>- Our families will be fighting forever.<br/><br/>- We'll elope! We'll elope, just you and me!<br/>- Yes! And go where no one can find us.<br/><br/>- Over my dead body.<br/>I won't allow you to elope.<br/><br/>- Sara!<br/>- Neither will I.<br/><br/>We won't allow you to get married—<br/><br/>- Godmother—<br/>- Godmother—<br/><br/>- if you plan on marrying<br/>anywhere other than here in Valleby.<br/><br/>Where you have all your relatives and friends.<br/><br/>- Think about it—how could<br/>we travel back to Sicily?<br/><br/>Without having a proper wedding first?<br/><br/>- Does that mean you want us to—<br/>- To get married.<br/><br/>-To get married.<br/><br/>- Dino!<br/>- Sara!<br/><br/>I said it would work out.<br/><br/>Oh, Focaccia! Valleby won the cup!<br/><br/>- This would never have been<br/>possible without your help.<br/><br/>It's a shame you're going home again soon.<br/>- I'll be back next summer.<br/><br/>- Hi!<br/><br/>- She'll be coming back next summer!<br/>- So cool!<br/><br/>- Then maybe you can teach me to be a detective?<br/>- Absolutely!<br/><br/>- A toast to Sara and Dino!<br/><br/>- Want to dance?<br/><br/>You'll regret this!<br/><br/>Clara!<br/><br/>English subtitles by<br/>faxeholm1234 and jeremys<br/><br/>TNT 2023</div>
