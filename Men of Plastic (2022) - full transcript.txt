Time's up.<br/><br/>Ji-woo.<br/><br/>That filler clinic from before--<br/>They really want to meet you.<br/><br/>Give them a call.<br/><br/>Hong Kyu-ok…<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>Bye.<br/><br/>Doctor, good to see you.<br/><br/>-Have you been well?<br/>-Yes, of course.<br/><br/>-Any mail?<br/>-Yes.<br/><br/>P&amp;K PLASTIC SURGERY<br/><br/>DIRECTOR DR. PARK JI-WOO<br/>CO-DIRECTOR DR. KIM SOL<br/><br/>You really should change your address.<br/><br/>-I'll take care of it.<br/>-Sure thing.<br/><br/>-It's really dusty here.<br/>-Sure. Take care!<br/><br/>Who is he?<br/><br/>Ex-director of this clinic.<br/><br/>He still thinks he owns this place.<br/><br/>This is his profile I managed<br/>when he was a hotshot.<br/><br/>You're managing my profile too, right?<br/><br/>What a pile of dog shit.<br/>Where would I ever use yours?<br/><br/>-At least pay your bar tab.<br/>-I will, when I make it big.<br/><br/>I'll never get it, then.<br/><br/>Do you still work as a matchmaker?<br/><br/>-Matchmaker?<br/>-Yeah.<br/><br/>-You're really pissing me off.<br/>-Why?<br/><br/>-Cupid agent!<br/>-Same shit.<br/><br/>Because of big corporations<br/>gobbling up all my clients,<br/><br/>I'm helping out at the wine bar<br/>to maintain my connections.<br/><br/>Ji-woo graduated<br/>top of his medical school.<br/><br/>What's more important is that<br/>his skill is among Korea's best.<br/><br/>The basics of surgery<br/>is the separation technique,<br/><br/>separating skin from the muscles<br/>accurately and quickly.<br/><br/>The pinnacle of plastic surgery.<br/><br/>Then you pull the separated skin<br/>as much as possible,<br/><br/>cut off the remaining skin<br/>and extract the fat,<br/><br/>and stitch them back together.<br/><br/>-That's the highlight of a face-lift.<br/>-Incredible…<br/><br/>I don't really follow. Then what?<br/><br/>Then the jawline comes alive<br/>even without double-jaw surgery.<br/><br/>-Like me.<br/>-They did a really good job on you.<br/><br/>-She looked like me before.<br/>-She had work done on her?<br/><br/>Too bad for him.<br/>He had a surgical hit job done on him,<br/><br/>and he got screwed.<br/><br/>What's that?<br/><br/>It's a tactic done<br/>on young hotshot doctors.<br/><br/>When Ji-woo was opening his clinic,<br/><br/>he pulled money from everywhere,<br/>including loan sharks.<br/><br/>He was a bit greedy.<br/><br/>Someone lured one of the nurses<br/>to steal propofol<br/><br/>and framed him for it.<br/><br/>He lost his medical license,<br/>and his clinic as well.<br/><br/>Due to the shock, his mother passed away.<br/><br/>He's still paying off the debt<br/>from those days.<br/><br/>-Until you get your license back…<br/>-You're doing the surgery right now.<br/><br/>If something goes wrong,<br/>you're responsible.<br/><br/>-I mean…<br/>-Man!<br/><br/>What was that? You got a text.<br/><br/>Ji-woo, wouldn't it okay<br/>to do my ghost surgeries for now…<br/><br/>PAYMENT IS OVERDUE. GOOD LUCK!<br/><br/>…and reveal yourself later?<br/><br/>He's been backstabbed so often<br/>that he's got trust issues.<br/><br/>You guys are friends now?<br/><br/>He's my friend's brother, and since when<br/>were you two on a first-name basis?<br/><br/>It'll take two years for him<br/>to get his license back.<br/><br/>It looked like Dr. Jang is greasing<br/>his junior to speed it up.<br/><br/>His junior?<br/><br/>Yeah, I took him on as a client<br/>because Dr. Jang asked me.<br/><br/>This is him. He's an uptight type.<br/><br/>CHOI SANG-HYUN<br/>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br/><br/>It's taking too long.<br/>It's easy to get the license back.<br/><br/>Look, Ji-woo's here.<br/><br/>-He's getting jacked by the loan sharks.<br/>-Damn.<br/><br/>Small world, eh?<br/><br/>Our clinic is exclusively for VIP members,<br/><br/>so the aesthetic shop closes at 6:00 p.m.,<br/><br/>and treatment starts at 9:00.<br/><br/>It could be a better deal<br/>than being a ghost surgeon.<br/><br/>Word will spread quickly.<br/>How do you manage security?<br/><br/>Our clientele includes the wives of<br/>district chiefs, the police commissioner,<br/><br/>and lovers of high-ranking officials.<br/><br/>Sit down.<br/><br/>I'm okay.<br/><br/>But to work here,<br/>you'll need to do some milk delivery.<br/><br/>I thought I'd only be doing<br/>filler treatments.<br/><br/>That's part of the job.<br/><br/>You know VIPs often have amnesia<br/>because of stress.<br/><br/>-You'll be visiting their homes to help--<br/>-Excuse me.<br/><br/>I think you need a drug dealer<br/>more than a doctor.<br/><br/>Isn't that why we're having a meeting?<br/><br/>Christ…<br/><br/>Ji-woo!<br/><br/>We'll be best friends at this rate.<br/><br/>Why do you keep making me--<br/><br/>What? What?<br/><br/>Hey, man.<br/><br/>-What's going on?<br/>-Did I startle you?<br/><br/>Come sit down.<br/><br/>You know these guys.<br/><br/>They're my boys.<br/><br/>Ki-cheol, I boxed with him,<br/>and Sung-jae, he wrestled.<br/><br/>I'm not curious at all.<br/><br/>Ji-woo is practically my own brother.<br/>Got it?<br/><br/>I heard he borrowed some money.<br/>Can you sort it out for him?<br/><br/>Excuse me?<br/><br/>Listen. We'll delay payment by six months,<br/><br/>and we'll just take the principal<br/>and call it even.<br/><br/>Just the principal payment.<br/><br/>All right, I hear you.<br/>Let's give him a bit more time.<br/><br/>One sec.<br/><br/>-Let's go with one year.<br/>-Very well, sir.<br/><br/>Good. Very good.<br/><br/>Is that good?<br/><br/>I know how you feel. Sung-jae.<br/><br/>-Yes, boss.<br/>-He's older than you.<br/><br/>Take good care of him. He's only 27.<br/><br/>-I'll treat you as my brother.<br/>-Please don't.<br/><br/>I waited until you got here<br/>so we can eat together. Dig in.<br/><br/>We'll just say hello and leave.<br/>We won't stay long, okay?<br/><br/>This is a soiree for Mi-jung's clients.<br/><br/>It'll be a big help to you.<br/><br/>There he is!<br/><br/>Ministry of Health, Mr. Choi.<br/><br/>Mr. Choi?<br/><br/>Yes, Mr. Choi. Come with me.<br/><br/>I recently found out about Mr. Choi here.<br/>He works at the Ministry of Health.<br/><br/>You work at a health center?<br/><br/>-You nuts?<br/>-He's a civil servant.<br/><br/>Anyway, this guy right here,<br/><br/>half of this country's workload<br/>has to go through his approval.<br/><br/>-That is incredible!<br/>-No, of course not!<br/><br/>-Hey, Ji-woo, Ji-woo?<br/>-Yes?<br/><br/>Pour Mr. Choi a drink.<br/><br/>-Pour him a drink!<br/>-Please…<br/><br/>-You guys can be blood brothers.<br/>-You two are the same age?<br/><br/>What the hell?<br/><br/>Could we do that?<br/><br/>Go on, do it.<br/><br/>Yes, of course.<br/><br/>Mi-jung!<br/><br/>Get him some freebie skin care treatments?<br/><br/>-Mind your own business, dipshit.<br/>-Let's all have a drink.<br/><br/>-Right. Raise your glasses.<br/>-For Mr. Choi.<br/><br/>For Mr. Choi!<br/><br/>Had we met earlier,<br/>I could've sorted everything out, right?<br/><br/>-I'm really thankful.<br/>-Go on.<br/><br/>But do you want something from me?<br/><br/>Well, I…<br/><br/>How can I put this delicately?<br/><br/>Right. This is what I do best.<br/><br/>If this cigarette needs a lighter,<br/><br/>I hook one up for it,<br/><br/>and if it needs an ashtray,<br/><br/>I hook it up.<br/><br/>That's what I do best.<br/><br/>So this time,<br/>I want to hook you up with me.<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>I'm starting a plastic surgery business.<br/><br/>And if I partner up with you,<br/><br/>it will be blissful.<br/><br/>Think about it.<br/><br/>You gotta work hard<br/>and get your clinic back.<br/><br/>How long will you live in a rental<br/>and get hassled by thugs?<br/><br/>Those who tasted Apgujeong<br/>can never leave here.<br/><br/>Can you drop your pride<br/>and move to the outskirts?<br/><br/>You can't.<br/><br/>-Are you listening?<br/>-Well, yes.<br/><br/>-I'm so thankful for everything.<br/>-Yes, yes.<br/><br/>But I really don't know you yet.<br/><br/>It's too soon to have this conversation…<br/><br/>-Mi-jung!<br/>-Yeah?<br/><br/>-Didn't Mr. Choi leave something?<br/>-Oh, yeah, he did.<br/><br/>Good. Why didn't you give this<br/>to me earlier?<br/><br/>This is for you.<br/><br/>Open it.<br/><br/>Oops. I don't smoke.<br/><br/>SURGEON LICENSE<br/><br/>How did you…<br/><br/>If one wants to work with<br/>an amazing man like you,<br/><br/>isn't this the minimum amount of effort?<br/><br/>Ji-woo, this is who I am.<br/><br/>Know what I mean?<br/><br/>I want to know what you mean.<br/><br/>KIM SOL PLASTIC SURGERY<br/><br/>Wait for it, you bastard.<br/><br/>Sir, could you raise the volume?<br/><br/>Okay!<br/><br/>Yes, Dr. Park.<br/><br/>I heard about the stakes from Dae-guk.<br/><br/>Yes, let's do it that way.<br/><br/>Let's meet up soon.<br/><br/>How did you take care of Park Ji-woo?<br/><br/>He only listens to me.<br/><br/>Anyway, thank you.<br/><br/>I'll have to pay you for your service.<br/><br/>I took care of it because you're like<br/>my little brother, not for money.<br/><br/>I almost made a big mistake.<br/><br/>You almost did.<br/><br/>What do you want?<br/><br/>You clue in so quickly.<br/><br/>Let's partner up now.<br/><br/>You really think you could work for me<br/>as a gangster at your age?<br/><br/>Why would I want to be a gangster,<br/>ass licker?<br/><br/>I'm talking about<br/>the plastic surgery business.<br/><br/>You know Wong's 15-floor building?

You couldn't stay…<br/><br/>Why are your lips so loose?<br/><br/>Christ!<br/><br/>Christ!<br/><br/>Christ! Then that license was a forgery?<br/><br/>Listen, I heard these cops<br/>are infamous thugs.<br/><br/>They're trying to get a leg up on us<br/>and rip us off.<br/><br/>-I'll take care of this.<br/>-How can you take care of it?<br/><br/>You scammed me with a fake license!<br/><br/>I didn't scam you.<br/>I issued a temporary license.<br/><br/>Why are you issuing licenses?<br/>How did you make a fake one?<br/><br/>We got the real one from Choi<br/>and opened this clinic. Isn't that enough?<br/><br/>How is that enough? What about cops?<br/><br/>Don't you dare lie to me<br/>and sweep this under the rug!<br/><br/>Come on…<br/><br/>I can succeed only if you do.<br/>Why would I lie to you?<br/><br/>Look at my face.<br/>Do I look like someone who'd lie?<br/><br/>-You should've told me…<br/>-Right…<br/><br/>-Dae-guk.<br/>-What?<br/><br/>-It's Tae-cheon.<br/>-You told him too?<br/><br/>-Christ!<br/>-Christ!<br/><br/>Cops aren't the problem, Chairman Wong is!<br/><br/>He's a former police chief,<br/><br/>so he drops out at the first sign<br/>of trouble with his foreign investment!<br/><br/>Our clinic and that<br/>15-floor hospital idea are done!<br/><br/>You talked to Big Dick<br/>about our hospital idea?<br/><br/>Is that important right now?<br/><br/>You're a funny thug.<br/><br/>-Of course it is. What did he say?<br/>-Forget it!<br/><br/>Pay those pigs off like they wanted.<br/><br/>If you start paying off cops,<br/>it'll turn into a habit.<br/><br/>Then what? Get my boys to work on them?<br/><br/>"Work on them"? Are you a gangster?<br/>Right, you are.<br/><br/>Guys like him must be crushed<br/>by their bosses.<br/><br/>Don't even have connections?<br/><br/>Man, I know someone in Major Crimes:<br/>Chief Choi.<br/><br/>We're like blood brothers.<br/>I'll sort this out.<br/><br/>Ji-woo, don't worry. I'll take care of it.<br/><br/>Hello. Wait…<br/><br/>The number doesn't…<br/><br/>-The line's busy. He's on the phone.<br/>-I have one.<br/><br/>I've got a connection.<br/><br/>It's Korea's first<br/>locally developed filler.<br/><br/>If you want to use my connection,<br/>I gotta have something in return.<br/><br/>-What's the cost of this?<br/>-Six dollars.<br/><br/>The ones on the market now<br/>are US-made and $170.<br/><br/>Wait, $6 and $170?<br/><br/>Hold on. Six times two is 12,<br/>six times three is…<br/><br/>How many folds is this?<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>If you swap this for<br/>the expensive German-made,<br/><br/>the cost rises to $500,<br/>and clients pay $1,200.<br/><br/>$1,200? Goddamn thieves… I'm sorry.<br/><br/>-Then why aren't people using this?<br/>-Hasn't been approved by the FDA.<br/><br/>It's awaiting approval.<br/><br/>But the effectiveness is certain.<br/>No side effects thus far.<br/><br/>Then what's your condition?<br/><br/>I'll supply, you sell,<br/>we split the profit 50-50.<br/><br/>50-50…<br/><br/>Then I'll set up the connection<br/>as a bonus of our deal.<br/><br/>I've done so many terrible things<br/>in my life while living here,<br/><br/>but that filler is…<br/><br/>Yeah, it's dangerous.<br/><br/>It really is. But there's no other way.<br/>What can we do about the pigs?<br/><br/>You still can't reach<br/>your detective friend?<br/><br/>His line is still busy.<br/><br/>What to do…<br/><br/>Don't do it?<br/><br/>No, Ji-woo.<br/><br/>One must earn like a dog<br/>and spend like a beast.<br/><br/>So we should?<br/><br/>Coin flip.<br/>Heads we do it, tails we don't. Okay?<br/><br/>-Bro.<br/>-Yeah?<br/><br/>Let's just do it.<br/><br/>I'm glad to proceed with our deal.<br/><br/>So, shall we talk about<br/>the bonus we discussed?<br/><br/>Whom should I introduce you to?<br/>The police commissioner's wife?<br/><br/>-Or his lover?<br/>-Wife would be…<br/><br/>No way. His lover.<br/><br/>Married couples don't talk.<br/><br/>Please ask him to have<br/>these officers off our backs.<br/><br/>Very well.<br/><br/>I'll talk to the commissioner.<br/><br/>No, to his lover…<br/><br/>Yes, I'll talk to him.<br/><br/>I've confirmed your deposit.<br/><br/>Make sure to send the remainder<br/>on this date.<br/><br/>All right.
