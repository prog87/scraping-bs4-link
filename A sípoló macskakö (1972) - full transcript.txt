</script><br/><br/>Hi!<br/><br/>Well, if you can't commit,<br/>you should say so,<br/><br/>but we need your decision now.<br/><br/>- Hello.<br/>- I'll be with you in a second.<br/><br/>Don't enter the tents!<br/>Line up outside!<br/><br/>We're all staying outside!<br/><br/>No kicking back! Get up!<br/><br/>Do you hear me? Fall in!<br/><br/>Everybody stay outside!<br/>Put down your luggage!<br/><br/>Do we have enough on our<br/>plate or what?! What's wrong?<br/><br/>Later...<br/><br/>Attention! Boys,<br/>attention, please.<br/><br/>Here we go.<br/><br/>My name is Béla Somló,<br/>some of you already know me,<br/><br/>I'm the commander of this camp.<br/><br/>Welcome to volunteer work camp!<br/><br/>For the next two weeks you'll<br/>live in camp, somewhat like soldiers.<br/><br/>So here's the army greeting:<br/>"Vigour and health!"<br/><br/>Vigour and health, boys!<br/><br/>Vigour and health!<br/><br/>Again! This time in unison!<br/><br/>Vigour and health!<br/><br/>Now go to your assigned tents,<br/>unpack,<br/><br/>then elect your tent captains.<br/><br/>At 5PM line up for hoisting the flag.<br/><br/>I'll fill you in on camp<br/>regulations then. Supper at 6:30.<br/><br/>That's all for now.<br/><br/>We haven't met before.<br/><br/>- Somló.<br/>- Dienes.<br/><br/>- Ever been to summer camp?<br/>- Not as a teacher.<br/><br/>Well then. Basics are the same.<br/><br/>We must adapt to given<br/>conditions, though.<br/><br/>We will discuss the details.<br/><br/>- Which are our tents? - How come<br/>you don't have the schedule?<br/><br/>Tents 7, 8 and 9 are yours.<br/><br/>You’ll divide your boys<br/>into 3 groups.<br/><br/>After they autonomously<br/>elect tent captains,<br/><br/>you’ll submit the final roster to me.<br/><br/>By the way, autonomy<br/>goes for all here.<br/><br/>You'll get used to it.<br/><br/>What is this army business rubbish?<br/><br/>He's into role-playing.<br/><br/>Fakir, what are you<br/>trying to hide there?<br/><br/>I'm looking for a cool spot<br/>for my tins.<br/><br/>I could use a bucket.<br/><br/>Have you elected your captain yet?<br/><br/>No, sir.<br/><br/>Here you go then.<br/>Where is the rest?<br/><br/>What's the big deal, sir?<br/><br/>Let it be Schuller and that's it.<br/><br/>No way! Pataki should be it.<br/><br/>What does a tent captain do?<br/><br/>You see how difficult it is<br/>to come to an agreement?<br/><br/>Fetch the rest and cast your votes!<br/>Beat it, Gyuris!<br/><br/>What does a captain do?<br/><br/>He represents the tent when needed.<br/><br/>He rats.<br/><br/>It is sad to take your leader<br/>for a mole.<br/><br/>Kiddo for captain!<br/><br/>Let's form alliances!<br/><br/>Sorry man, this is strictly private.<br/><br/>I'm out of here, too.<br/><br/>My vote is up for sale.<br/><br/>- Let me do it.<br/>- Swing it a little.<br/><br/>What if he picked up 3<br/>names at the same time?<br/><br/>World Champion.<br/><br/>Catch it!<br/><br/>Well...<br/><br/>Zoltán Tőkés.<br/><br/>Fuck off! I won't be captain.<br/><br/>What do you mean? You're it!<br/><br/>- Dienes won't agree to it.<br/>- Tough luck.<br/><br/>Is this a democracy or what?<br/><br/>I think there's no need<br/>for a big address.<br/><br/>You all know why you signed up<br/>to this camp.<br/><br/>Let me relate a warm welcome<br/><br/>from the leaders of the state-farm,<br/><br/>who all regret not being able<br/>to be here now.<br/><br/>Copy that.<br/><br/>Things...<br/><br/>may turn out to be<br/>different than you expect,<br/><br/>but I trust we'll be<br/>mostly on the same page.<br/><br/>To give you a teaser<br/>from our program schedule.<br/><br/>a gathering with members of the<br/>village Communist Youth Organization<br/><br/>- Yippee!<br/>- I can't wait!<br/><br/>A concert by a Budapest pop-group<br/><br/>A young Hungarian-born French<br/>teacher will lecture<br/><br/>about French schools.<br/><br/>Wake-up call at 5AM...<br/><br/>- morning exercise at 5:10.<br/>- Is this a joke or what?<br/><br/>breakfast at 5:30,<br/><br/>work from 6 to noon,<br/><br/>afternoons are free for<br/>sports and entertainment,<br/><br/>supper at 6:30PM,<br/><br/>lights out at 9PM.<br/><br/>Come on!<br/><br/>It is forbidden to leave camp<br/>without the commandant's permission!<br/><br/>It is forbidden to plunge<br/>into the fish-pond!<br/><br/>The pond's been manured,<br/><br/>offenders risk contracting<br/>some serious skin-disease.<br/><br/>Sure!<br/><br/>Showers are at your<br/>disposal at all times,<br/><br/>if you feel hot, just stand in<br/><br/>but water supply is limited,<br/>since water is delivered by cart.<br/><br/>Finally I announce<br/><br/>that due to procedural reasons<br/>work is cancelled for tomorrow.<br/><br/>The daily schedule will change<br/>accordingly,<br/><br/>wake-up call at 7AM and so on.<br/><br/>Raise the flag now!<br/><br/>Tent captains, report to the canteen!<br/><br/>The rest is dismissed!<br/><br/>What the fuck is<br/>"procedural reasons"?<br/><br/>It sounds like "died of<br/>undisclosed causes".<br/><br/>Zoltán as captain is in deep shit.<br/><br/>Marci!<br/><br/>From now on, I need you<br/>to deliver your best!<br/><br/>Lavish meals, as many helpings<br/>as they want,<br/><br/>always with a generous amount<br/>of the usual downer.<br/><br/>That's what we can do.<br/><br/>Provided I get the enough supplies.<br/><br/>Your boss has promised it.<br/><br/>I don't know about that.<br/><br/>I had to discard two pairs<br/>of boots<br/><br/>and a headless pickaxe.<br/><br/>How do you know it's a pickaxe then?<br/><br/>What do you mean by<br/>how do I know?<br/><br/>This is a pickaxe-helve, that's how.<br/><br/>That lousy water cart should be<br/>here already.<br/><br/>Go and see, will you?<br/><br/>How do I know?<br/><br/>What happened?<br/><br/>A never ending sermon, what else?<br/><br/>The captain of group C<br/><br/>that guy is a genuine asshole.<br/><br/>Why won't we work tomorrow?<br/><br/>They didn't say.<br/><br/>We got the night-watch schedule.<br/>There will be competitions, too.<br/><br/>Like what?<br/><br/>Ping-Pong, soccer, chess, whatnot.<br/><br/>Tents will compete in work<br/><br/>as well as in spit and polish.<br/><br/>Dienes assigned me<br/><br/>to draft a cultural program<br/>proposal by tomorrow.<br/><br/>The captain of group C suggested<br/>in all sincerity<br/><br/>to name the camp after someone<br/><br/>and prepare a memorial<br/>program in honour of that person.<br/><br/>Luckily he was voted down.<br/>One day I’ll just kill that guy.<br/><br/>Dinner time!<br/><br/>Before the day breaks<br/>singing youth wake it up<br/><br/>with a happy smile.<br/><br/>Neither windstorm, nor<br/>burning sun can stop us,<br/><br/>we shall turn the swamp<br/>into lush garden.<br/><br/>Hey youth, keep up the good work,<br/><br/>witness of great deeds,<br/>the Communist Party is calling.<br/><br/>New ditches fill up with water<br/><br/>in the marshland formerly<br/>unknown to men.<br/><br/>Let us grab spades<br/>and shovels, fellows!<br/><br/>Let us turn the swamp into lush soil<br/><br/>It is absurd, but I feel<br/>I need to check on what's going on.<br/><br/>It has nothing to do with being<br/>tent captain,<br/><br/>it's like an instinct.<br/><br/>Insane, isn't it?<br/><br/>And you are having issues<br/>with captain of group C?<br/><br/>Moron!<br/><br/>Fall in!<br/>Stop playing around, boys!<br/><br/>Get them to do some exercises,<br/><br/>- Gymnastics or something.<br/>- I'll be back in a sec.<br/><br/>Find out what's up with Somló,<br/>will you.<br/><br/>- I'm afraid he's still asleep.<br/>- Sure.<br/><br/>Could you please, check on<br/>comrade Somló?<br/><br/>- What about hi or hello?<br/>- Sorry. Good morning.<br/><br/>Could he be - still asleep?<br/><br/>You know what? Even that<br/>wouldn't surprize me anymore.<br/><br/>Back off from the window!<br/><br/>Away from that window!<br/><br/>Fall in for calisthenics!<br/><br/>Lift your arms!<br/><br/>Mind your distance!<br/><br/>Your name?<br/><br/>- Ernő Lencse.<br/>- With a triple umlaut.<br/><br/>- Foot-size?<br/>- 41.<br/><br/>One pair of boots.<br/><br/>What a lovely smirk!<br/>Happy to see us, dear?<br/><br/>A pair of trousers.<br/>What kind of tool do you want?<br/><br/>Number of your tent?<br/><br/>8.<br/><br/>Three hoes, one pick, a shovel,<br/><br/>you'll get a rake, son.<br/><br/>Do you think you’re in a shoe store?<br/>Come here and sign off!<br/><br/>What's your name?<br/><br/>Ernő, please!<br/><br/>A pair of trousers.<br/><br/>Don't bother, I won't wear these.<br/><br/>Is that so?<br/>Just you wait until being enlisted!<br/><br/>Now it's time to lay you to rest.<br/><br/>Next we'll be required<br/>to build a drawbridge.<br/><br/>Come on, guys! It has to be done.<br/><br/>Look who's talking!<br/><br/>I didn't volunteer to be boss, did I?<br/><br/>Énekes, get the fuck up!<br/><br/>Actually, why is it left<br/>to us to dig this ditch?<br/><br/>What about those before us?<br/><br/>The Soporific is here!<br/><br/>Well, boys, how's work going?<br/><br/>Going, going.<br/><br/>How are you holding that shovel, son?<br/><br/>This is how it's done.<br/><br/>We'll have a competition<br/>in spit and polish.<br/><br/>The winning tent will be entrusted<br/><br/>with redecorating the flagpole<br/>area in a creative way.<br/><br/>Scores will reflect imperative<br/>orderliness<br/><br/>and creative ideas.<br/><br/>You may stop working<br/>during announcement.<br/><br/>What is this? What's going<br/>on here, please? Who's your captain?<br/><br/>- I am.<br/>- What is this pigsty?<br/><br/>I see this one more time<br/>and you'll be terminated.<br/><br/>We'll be back in five.<br/>I want this cleaned up by then.<br/><br/>This is a disgrace!<br/>You deserve a penalty point.<br/><br/>May I be terminated now?<br/><br/>Be quiet!<br/>Sit down there, boys!<br/><br/>You, over there, you too!<br/><br/>Sit down, son!<br/><br/>- I'm super-hyper.<br/>- I have to pee!<br/><br/>Jesus!<br/><br/>Do you think it is manured for real?<br/><br/>Why on earth manure a fishpond?<br/><br/>This is ill-mannered,<br/>not to mention the disgrace!<br/><br/>What will they think of you?<br/><br/>Prominent Budapest<br/>students staring like creeps<br/><br/>What about a poem or<br/>a scene, at least<br/><br/>an attempt to reciprocate<br/>their generosity.<br/><br/>This is an inacceptable way<br/>to handle this get-together.<br/><br/>Here you go, clever boys!<br/><br/>Don't hide, I'm talking to you!<br/><br/>and so are the villagers.<br/><br/>Come on, respond to them!<br/><br/>Pun unintended,<br/><br/>you are the country bumpkins,<br/>not them.<br/><br/>I didn't expect this monumental show.<br/><br/>Who's in charge of cultural events?<br/><br/>- He's one of yours, right?<br/>- Yes. His name is Tőkés.<br/><br/>It's a bit too soon.<br/><br/>I'll try to find him.<br/><br/>Are you done with the program<br/>schedule?<br/><br/>- Not yet.<br/>- Then you better vanish!<br/><br/>- What did he want?<br/>- Nothing.<br/><br/>- Do you have a moment?<br/>- Sure.<br/><br/>Next time we have to match<br/>their effort.<br/><br/>I'd like to phone my<br/>wife, she's very pregnant.<br/><br/>- Now? Phone her? How?<br/>- I'd take the bus to town.<br/><br/>Go if you have to, although...<br/><br/>I thought I wouldn't<br/>be needed at this hour.<br/><br/>All right then.<br/>Tonight is a blunder anyway.<br/><br/>We must invite them back<br/>and reciprocate their show.<br/><br/>We'll discuss it later. See you.<br/><br/>See you.<br/><br/>Tell me, is this guy married?<br/><br/>I think so. Why?<br/><br/>Never mind.<br/><br/>In case farm kids have to<br/>herd kettle when not in school,<br/><br/>they are at a disadvantage.<br/><br/>If they have some downtime,<br/>they stand a better chance.<br/><br/>Another topic may be motivation<br/><br/>of course, situation in<br/>the city may be similar.<br/><br/>If urban kids have downtime<br/><br/>and space, if they’re motivated<br/><br/>all 3 bullet points<br/>these are 3 critical bullet points<br/><br/>then their environment<br/>is preferential.<br/><br/>Well, since motivation<br/>is most imperative,<br/><br/>if parents are motivated, too,<br/>then we're fine. Just fine.<br/><br/>Well I've sent some of my farm<br/>kids even to quiz shows<br/><br/>on several occasions.<br/>I'm telling you.<br/><br/>What will you do here for two weeks?<br/><br/>Work at the state farm,<br/>I don't know what.<br/><br/>There's no work for you.<br/>You haven't been told?<br/><br/>- What do you mean?<br/>- What did I tell you?<br/><br/>Really?<br/><br/>Are you serious?<br/>Am I the first to tell you?<br/><br/>This sounds fishy.<br/><br/>Why are you so worked up?<br/><br/>We won't work. Great.<br/><br/>So this is the reason<br/>for the outing tomorrow.<br/><br/>Shut up, let him talk.<br/><br/>I don't know.<br/><br/>I've heard that something<br/>went wrong...<br/><br/>The corn hasn't tasselled yet,<br/><br/>because of bad weather,<br/>late sowing,<br/><br/>they may have something else for you.<br/><br/>And why?<br/><br/>The corn hasn't tasselled.<br/>Obvious, isn’t it?<br/><br/>So we’re going home?<br/><br/>Why do they keep us in the dark?<br/><br/>- Maybe they’ve just found out.<br/>- Bullshit.<br/><br/>They don't have the balls to tell us.<br/>They think we won't notice.<br/><br/>They think we forget<br/>that we signed up to work.<br/><br/>What do you want?<br/>To form a negotiating committee?<br/><br/>This is intolerable!<br/><br/>Let's draft a petition!<br/><br/>- A peti- what?<br/>- Stop fooling.<br/><br/>Their bluff works only if<br/>we don't speak up.<br/><br/>- What's holding you back?<br/>- Nothing.<br/><br/>- What are you waiting for?<br/>- We should all go.<br/><br/>Man, I'm afraid you're a lonely hero.<br/><br/>- Listen, boys!<br/>- What?<br/><br/>The time is out of joint.<br/><br/>Vincze, are you coming?<br/><br/>Where the fuck do<br/>you want to go now?<br/><br/>To check out the club scene.<br/><br/>Village folks will<br/>beat you to a pulp.<br/><br/>Seriously,<br/><br/>we'll wait until our brains fry<br/>in this detention camp?<br/><br/>It's still better than<br/>slaving in the cornfield.<br/><br/>Your brain would fry there for real.<br/><br/>What does tasselling mean?<br/><br/>- Does it matter?<br/>- Tassels are not out.<br/><br/>Is that wrong? They aren’t.<br/>Shit happens.<br/><br/>Female row tassels must be pulled<br/><br/>to prevent self-impregnation.<br/><br/>Soporific's here!<br/><br/>I'll turn off the<br/>lights in five minutes.<br/><br/>Tomorrow morning we'll<br/>visit the Bajom ruins.<br/><br/>I expect civilized behaviour<br/>from all of you during the trip.<br/><br/>Your demeanour tonight<br/>was an embarrassment.<br/><br/>The villagers will<br/>be back on Sunday,<br/><br/>then you'll have a chance to save<br/>face by preparing<br/><br/>a cultural program for them.<br/><br/>Good night.<br/><br/>A spare soporific pill anyone?<br/><br/>Why haven't you asked<br/>him about the hush up?<br/><br/>Ask yourself.<br/><br/>Fuck it, you are the<br/>tent captain, or what?<br/><br/>What if he admitted there<br/>won't be any work ever?<br/><br/>Would you start a riot?<br/><br/>He’ll never admit to anything.<br/><br/>Then why waste our<br/>precious summer here?<br/><br/>Don’t you worry about summer here.<br/><br/>Outings, chess championship,<br/>long distance pissing,<br/><br/>- sack-race, dodgeball...<br/>- Shut up already!<br/><br/>You'll have plenty of time to snooze.<br/><br/>Listen!<br/><br/>What is this?<br/><br/>It must be some bird.<br/><br/>Bird, my ass. Yodelling it is.<br/><br/>This is insane. Where are we?<br/><br/>What is yodelling?<br/><br/>This is it, moron, what you hear.<br/><br/>Is it an instrument? Like some pipe?<br/><br/>Sure, it's a pipe. A throat pipe.<br/><br/>What an idiot! Let's go.<br/><br/>Wait for me, I am getting dressed.<br/><br/>- Where is Prof Dienes?<br/>- He went for a stroll in the village.<br/><br/>I'm sure he hooked up with a dame.<br/><br/>Fuck them, how am I supposed<br/>to tie my shoelaces now?<br/><br/>Do you need a torch?<br/><br/>You’ll tie them out in the moonlight.<br/><br/>Who knows the way?<br/><br/>It would be ironic if<br/>we bumped into Dienes.<br/><br/>I bet he'd join us.<br/><br/>Wait! I'm going with you.<br/><br/>Taking a dump in the lake<br/>is prohibited.<br/><br/>Some moon-tan lotion, anyone?<br/><br/>Don't do that!<br/><br/>- Is this all?<br/>- Yes. Yes.<br/><br/>I feel, I feel...<br/><br/>These are the ruins of<br/>the inner tower,<br/><br/>this used to be a storage area.<br/><br/>It was surrounded by a<br/>protective wall, still standing,<br/><br/>outside of it there was a moat.<br/><br/>The first owners were<br/><br/>the Csák family, followed by<br/>the royal dynasty of Árpád,<br/><br/>then the Rozgonyis,<br/>finally the Esterházys.<br/><br/>Well, that's about all.<br/><br/>Thank you kindly.<br/><br/>May I have your attention!<br/><br/>It's 12:25 now,<br/><br/>you're free until 3PM.<br/><br/>Hold it, I'm not done!<br/><br/>We'll meet back here at 3 sharp.<br/><br/>Don't go too far, we<br/>won't wait for latecomers.<br/><br/>Dismissed.<br/><br/>Let's find a coffee place.<br/><br/>Shouldn't we keep an eye on them?<br/><br/>They are not toddlers anymore.<br/><br/>They should discharge their<br/>steam here and not in the camp.<br/><br/>Summer is vacation time. We<br/>must be careful about what to push.<br/><br/>For example, forcing the educational<br/>aspect of this outing may remind them<br/><br/>that they signed up<br/>for something else.<br/><br/>This way they're having a good time,<br/><br/>still, they are in<br/>an organized community.<br/><br/>And honestly,<br/><br/>isn't this the aim<br/>of a voluntary work camp?<br/><br/>Indeed.<br/><br/>The idea is to keep them busy<br/>all the time.<br/><br/>Still, I am somewhat concerned,<br/><br/>not to mention the loss<br/>to the national economy.<br/><br/>Come on! First I was concerned,<br/>too, I even protested.<br/><br/>Then I realized<br/><br/>that for educational purposes<br/>this is a classic situation.<br/><br/>that offers us great opportunities,<br/><br/>provided...<br/><br/>we find an opening<br/>to the kids' mind-set, of course.<br/><br/>It is just as well<br/>part of the challenge<br/><br/>to get them recognize<br/>our objectives.<br/><br/>The point is to be<br/>constantly watchful.<br/><br/>That's not it.<br/><br/>If we succeed,<br/><br/>we could even leave, go home,<br/>or whatever...<br/><br/>They would keep<br/>working on autopilot.<br/><br/>Definitely. I meant that, too.<br/><br/>And then where to? Home?<br/><br/>No way! That would be even worse.<br/><br/>Then what?<br/><br/>I don't know yet.<br/>I'll play it by ear.<br/><br/>That will wear out fast.<br/><br/>Not as fast as this, here.<br/><br/>Just think about it.<br/><br/>Soporific may call the police<br/>and you'll be busted in no time.<br/><br/>Next they’ll crush you<br/>at school in the fall.<br/><br/>I can't assess pros and<br/>cons and I don’t want to.<br/><br/>Bolting would make sense only<br/><br/>if the whole camp did it,<br/>or at least a whole tent.<br/><br/>Do you want me to argue<br/>with those dickheads<br/><br/>who came to get community<br/>service credit<br/><br/>to boost their college application?<br/><br/>Why did you come, then?<br/><br/>You won't believe it.<br/><br/>To be away from home.<br/><br/>By the way, I think<br/>you're chickens like the rest.<br/><br/>Call me chicken if you want.<br/><br/>No one will destroy me for nothing.<br/><br/>It's convenient to dismiss what’s<br/>uncomfortable for you to confront.<br/><br/>We're talking specifically about you.<br/><br/>Bolting equals excluding<br/>any option<br/><br/>of a reasonable action.<br/><br/>- Where do you see a reasonable<br/>action? - Where?<br/><br/>It's sitting in the grass.<br/><br/>How about trying something else?<br/><br/>Bolting is nothing.<br/><br/>It's the same as pretending<br/>there will be work in the camp.<br/><br/>Look, guys!<br/><br/>Morons! My back!<br/><br/>This is my first time abroad.<br/><br/>Mine too.<br/><br/>When did we cross the border?<br/><br/>Guys, I feel homesick.<br/><br/>That's a Czech bus over there.<br/><br/>This is how far you can get,<br/><br/>or you may defect to Czechoslovakia.<br/><br/>Moron. You just don't get<br/>the picture.<br/><br/>Let's go back.<br/><br/>- Are you chickening out?<br/>- What time is it?<br/><br/>I take three lemons,<br/><br/>when I eat them I turn yellow<br/>from them.<br/><br/>I'll be yellow as a lemon<br/><br/>I love chocolate.<br/><br/>I take three brushes,<br/><br/>when I eat them I turn hairy<br/>from them.<br/><br/>I'll be hairy as a brush<br/><br/>I love chocolate.<br/><br/>I take three cigars,<br/><br/>when I eat them I turn long<br/>from them.<br/><br/>I'll be long as a cigar<br/><br/>I love chocolate.<br/><br/>I take three pots,<br/><br/>when I eat them I turn into a kettle<br/>from them.<br/><br/>You may sit on your own stove<br/>at home, kid, but not this one!<br/><br/>What is it?<br/><br/>You all need a good<br/>thrashing for discipline.<br/><br/>- What is it?<br/>- He slapped me on the face.<br/><br/>And why? You destroyed the stove<br/>and behaved disrespectfully.<br/><br/>- Did I really?<br/>- Here’s your restitution money.<br/><br/>- What's going on here?<br/>- This man hit Hasznos for no reason.<br/><br/>- Are you their teacher?<br/>- I am. Why did you hit him?<br/><br/>None of your business.<br/>You’d better keep order.<br/><br/>Where do you think you are?<br/>In the woods? This is a train station.<br/><br/>They gallop around and destroy<br/>the furniture.<br/><br/>I hit him because you<br/>failed to do so! Understood?<br/><br/>Understood?<br/><br/>Who do you think you're talking to?<br/><br/>You call yourself a teacher?<br/>Your diploma should be revoked.<br/><br/>Let's call the police!<br/><br/>That won’t help. He'll<br/>say whatever he wants.<br/><br/>We are all witnesses.<br/><br/>Should I say it wouldn't matter much?<br/><br/>A good thrashing it is.<br/>Still not too late.<br/><br/>Stay! Hold it!<br/><br/>I still don't get what’s happened.<br/><br/>Stop! Come back!<br/><br/>Girls!<br/><br/>Girls!<br/><br/>- Why did we stop?<br/>- The signal turned red.<br/><br/>Here of all places?<br/><br/>Stop!<br/><br/>Where are you going?<br/>Come back here!<br/><br/>Come back here!<br/><br/>Your train is leaving.<br/><br/>Stop the train!<br/><br/>Watch out! Stop the train!<br/><br/>- Who pulled the emergency brake?<br/>- I did, sir.<br/><br/>A bunch of these scoundrels<br/>jumped off the train.<br/><br/>They had to climb back.<br/>They will be fittingly punished.<br/><br/>This emergency brake was<br/>sealed. I will be held accountable.<br/><br/>You will have to pay a fine.<br/>It will be quite a hefty sum.<br/><br/>We'll pay the fine alright,<br/><br/>but I couldn't just watch<br/>them breaking their necks.<br/><br/>We stop when asked nicely,<br/>no need to abuse the brake.<br/><br/>Pulling it is expensive.<br/><br/>You have a problem<br/>you tell me, we stop.<br/><br/>2, 4, 6, 8, 10<br/><br/>- He's bolted for real.<br/>- I still saw him on the train.<br/><br/>9 only. Who's missing?<br/><br/>Is he gone?<br/><br/>Who saw him last? Where?<br/><br/>I don't think he was on the train.<br/><br/>Don't lie to me, he was there.<br/><br/>That slap upset him.<br/><br/>I did not lie. I haven't seen him.<br/><br/>I saw him last at the train station.<br/><br/>Will you call the police on him?<br/><br/>Who said anything about police?<br/><br/>Maybe he hasn't run away.<br/><br/>Maybe he’ll return later tonight.<br/><br/>You must know, sir, that<br/>he ran away<br/><br/>and won't come back.<br/><br/>By the way, he had<br/>told me that was his plan.<br/><br/>Are you provoking to be punished?<br/><br/>Posing as a victim<br/>won't get you any mileage.<br/><br/>You may be correct<br/>and he may not come back.<br/><br/>Still, I have a hunch he will.<br/><br/>Don't be disappointed<br/>if he shows up.<br/><br/>Wait for me here<br/><br/>and give some thoughts to all this.<br/><br/>I still don't get it. Did he<br/>really hit him out of the blue?<br/><br/>Nonsense.<br/><br/>No offense, but I just don't buy it.<br/><br/>Something should be done<br/>about that kid, before...<br/><br/>before the police brings him back.<br/><br/>Obviously. We need to talk it over.<br/><br/>We'll have to notify his parents<br/>eventually.<br/><br/>The entire camp knows<br/>already, I guess.<br/><br/>Not yet. His tent only.<br/><br/>Then persuade them<br/>to keep a lid on it.<br/><br/>In case he doesn't return, the<br/>official version is that I released him.<br/><br/>If these all start running away...<br/><br/>I'm sorry, it’s too<br/>late to contemplate that.<br/><br/>They have good reason to run away.<br/><br/>It was irresponsible to<br/>agree to this situation.<br/><br/>Is that so? How clever of you!<br/><br/>Of course, it's an unpopular duty.<br/>Still, it has to be done.<br/><br/>You should rather<br/>consider the options<br/><br/>and get back to me if<br/>you have a viable idea.<br/><br/>So far I can't think of any.<br/><br/>Take this camp as an<br/>extension of the school-year,<br/><br/>as education in pragmatic<br/>forms of community life.<br/><br/>Not long ago I also used to think<br/><br/>"community life" was just a slogan,<br/><br/>then I learned by<br/>experience that it does exist,<br/><br/>and we have to learn<br/>its different forms<br/><br/>in order to fit into the<br/>society<br/><br/>built of communities, because<br/>only well-running communities<br/><br/>can accomplish important<br/>social tasks.<br/><br/>And what’s the social task<br/><br/>you have in store for our<br/>little community here?<br/><br/>This is not even a community yet.<br/><br/>Our very task would be to create one.<br/><br/>And what about work?<br/>There won't be any at all?<br/><br/>There will be, we just<br/>don't know yet, when.<br/><br/>One more thing.<br/>We are in a fix, too.<br/><br/>We have to figure out<br/>a total switch-over on the fly.<br/><br/>However, we could have<br/>a nice and prolific time,<br/><br/>if only...<br/><br/>you could overcome your scepticism.<br/><br/>Trust me, we don’t<br/>want to deceive you.<br/><br/>Why the hush up, then?<br/><br/>If it was up to me,<br/>I would talk openly.<br/><br/>But it's only a technicality,<br/>it wouldn't change the facts.<br/><br/>I'm sure professor<br/>Somló has his reasons.<br/><br/>- And what are those?<br/>- Higher considerations.<br/><br/>It's very hot here.<br/>Aren’t you sweating, sir?<br/><br/>How witty of you.<br/><br/>What about Hasznos?<br/><br/>If he doesn't return<br/>we’ll notify his parents.<br/><br/>His parents? Good luck.<br/><br/>So, if we agree to shut up,<br/>you’ll leave him alone.<br/><br/>I won't lose my temper,<br/>no matter how hard you're trying.<br/><br/>I've been as frank<br/>with you as I can.<br/><br/>- The whole camp knows it.<br/>- I don't care!<br/><br/>Don't hold back. It's between us.<br/><br/>Look, boys, I know how<br/>the land lies,<br/><br/>just like you do.<br/><br/>I'm only asking you to<br/>consider my situation.<br/><br/>In exchange I will<br/>not misinform you.<br/><br/>I appreciate that you want to<br/>speak and to be spoken to honestly,<br/><br/>so I expect you to appreciate<br/><br/>that it’s not always an available<br/>option for all.<br/><br/>I have nothing to say to those<br/>who view this as a bargain.<br/><br/>They will have to<br/>get by on their own.<br/><br/>Is it true that a<br/>guy from this tent ran off?<br/><br/>Yes. So it seems.<br/><br/>Why can't you let him be?<br/>Don't you see that he’s done?<br/><br/>So? Who cares?<br/><br/>We gave him a hard time. This<br/>is what you all wanted, isn't it?<br/><br/>Why don't you fuck<br/>with Soporific instead?<br/><br/>This guy is dead meat.<br/><br/>Did you buy his shtick for real?<br/><br/>They've cooked it all up with<br/>Soporific before he came here.<br/><br/>What's the big idea? You<br/>want to dismiss the camp?<br/><br/>He just loves to hear his own voice.<br/><br/>He pissed me off when<br/>he just stood there whimpering,<br/><br/>when Hasznos was hit, pretending<br/>he didn't know what had happened.<br/><br/>- And what did you do?<br/>- What about you?<br/><br/>- I wasn't even there.<br/>- Oh, that one.<br/><br/>Hasznos should have<br/>reciprocated the punch.<br/><br/>When did he get away?<br/><br/>Probably when we stopped<br/>by the girls’ camp.<br/><br/>Wow! He climbed<br/>through to the chicks!<br/><br/>Is that the sole thing<br/>on your mind, little stud?<br/><br/>We'll go, too, to<br/>visit the chicks.<br/><br/>Go fuck yourselves!<br/><br/>This can't be real!<br/><br/>It sounds more forlorn<br/>than last night.<br/><br/>It may break eventually.<br/><br/>Still, I ask you to release<br/>them, let them go home.<br/><br/>I've been quite clear, I think.<br/><br/>You have your budget anyway<br/>and your kids get a free vacation.<br/><br/>It is out of the question.<br/><br/>Enough is enough!<br/><br/>The whole mob is sitting on the<br/>trailers and they refuse to get off!<br/><br/>Oh, I forgot about the trailers.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we need them<br/>elsewhere, we can't give them a tour.<br/><br/>Well, come on, move it! Get off!<br/><br/>The fun ride is cancelled!<br/><br/>What is this? Chase<br/>them out, will you.<br/><br/>Get out of the store!<br/><br/>Forget the booze!<br/>Move it! Move it!<br/><br/>Clear the trailers, they're<br/>needed elsewhere!<br/><br/>Fall in! Stand up!<br/><br/>Stop it!<br/><br/>Stop fooling! Fall in!<br/><br/>Move it! Get off!<br/><br/>Clear the trailers! Form a line!<br/><br/>Don't you hear what your<br/>prof is saying? Off the trailers!<br/><br/>Move it!<br/><br/>Don't be sloths. Move it!<br/><br/>Jump off!<br/><br/>Line up by tents!<br/><br/>Mind the distance!<br/><br/>Straighten the line!<br/><br/>Here comes a little surprise.<br/><br/>We'll move back to the<br/>camp by way of a relay race.<br/><br/>Excuse me?<br/><br/>The track is about 5 km long.<br/>That means 500 m for each runner.<br/><br/>That won't kill anyone.<br/><br/>Members of the winning<br/>tent will be awarded.<br/><br/>I won't disclose the<br/>nature of the award yet.<br/><br/>Determine the running<br/>order of your team.<br/><br/>Starters stay put here,<br/><br/>the rest leaves for the camp<br/><br/>and take up positions every 500 m.<br/><br/>- What a treat!<br/>- Line up at the start line!<br/><br/>I ran a leg between main roads.<br/><br/>Traffic was blocked for the race.<br/><br/>The street was still paved<br/>with cobblestones.<br/><br/>Running the last leg and possibly<br/>breast the tape was the thing to do,<br/><br/>however, I ran the leg<br/>closest to our school,<br/><br/>so my friends saw me<br/>taking over the baton first.<br/><br/>Hello. Are you from the camp?<br/><br/>- Yes.<br/>- I'm looking for the camp commander.<br/><br/>That's him, on horseback.<br/><br/>I'll wet my pants!<br/><br/>The race is getting close!<br/>Line up for handoff!<br/><br/>Good morning. My name is<br/>Jean Faloux.<br/><br/>Oh. You're the Frenchman,<br/>aren't you?<br/><br/>Well, you know, we're<br/>preparing for a race here.<br/><br/>Please, wait for me<br/>at the state farm yard.<br/><br/>I'll be there in half an hour.<br/><br/>But at the moment we can't...<br/>we're getting ready for the race.<br/><br/>I see.<br/><br/>Well, I'll look around until then.<br/><br/>Line up for handoff!<br/><br/>Fall in!<br/><br/>What? Are you running, too?<br/><br/>Yes, for a boy from<br/>tent 6, he's sick today.<br/><br/>Well, it’s up to you.<br/><br/>Wait for me!<br/><br/>This is insane.<br/><br/>- Hi.<br/>- Hi.<br/><br/>Get a drink.<br/><br/>- Good morning.<br/>- Good morning.<br/><br/>- You are from the camp, aren't you?<br/>- Sure.<br/><br/>- I hear there is no work for you.<br/>- It's true.<br/><br/>I have a job for five or six,<br/><br/>some hoeing.<br/><br/>My cornfield is full of weed.<br/>I can pay 8 forints.<br/><br/>Tomorrow?<br/><br/>Let's say tomorrow.<br/>The sooner the better.<br/><br/>How come you need us<br/>and the state farm doesn't?<br/><br/>They spray their corn from airplanes.<br/><br/>We didn't have time to hoe our corn<br/><br/>because we had to work<br/>for the state farm.<br/><br/>So, can you come? I live over there.<br/><br/>We'll see if we can get away<br/>from the camp, you know.<br/><br/>- Did you ask others, too?<br/>- I asked a few.<br/><br/>- And what did they say?<br/>- Some said yes,<br/><br/>others said no, they can't.<br/><br/>We shall have a joust for you<br/>tomorrow.<br/><br/>Do we have enough<br/>on our plate or what?!<br/><br/>This soup is cold, sweetie.<br/><br/>- What a gorgeous specimen.<br/>- I bet he'll drink it.<br/><br/>Put down the money first.<br/><br/>Hark, villain! I will grind your<br/>bones to dust!<br/><br/>8 forints? You're nuts!<br/><br/>How would we sneak out of the camp?<br/><br/>Come on!<br/><br/>I don't think it's worth<br/>the risk of being busted.<br/><br/>- What is worth the risk then?<br/>- Better pay or something,<br/><br/>or some fun prank.<br/><br/>- To be honest...<br/>- To be honest?<br/><br/>if only a few will go, they'll<br/>definitely crush all of you.<br/><br/>Here comes a handsome puke.<br/><br/>Long live the republic!<br/><br/>OK, let's take action together,<br/>as you're suggesting.<br/><br/>I'm in.<br/><br/>Who else promised the farmer to go?<br/><br/>Cool it. These are<br/>only hypothetical ideas.<br/><br/>We need to get through<br/>these two weeks, that's all.<br/><br/>I agree, but we<br/>should use our brains.<br/><br/>There's no moral ground to<br/>reprimand anyone in this chaos.<br/><br/>Sorry, we signed up to work, there<br/>was none, so we found some.<br/><br/>End of story.<br/><br/>Hold it for a second.<br/><br/>Why is this hoeing job such<br/>a big deal to you?<br/><br/>I want to make some money.<br/><br/>My ass! Should I tell you why?<br/><br/>This is your way to get back<br/><br/>at Dienes for having chastised you.<br/>This is psychology.<br/><br/>You are a moron! He's totally a moron.<br/><br/>Watch my words. You'll<br/>be the only one to go.<br/><br/>Who told you I will?<br/><br/>- Would you join us if we went?<br/>- I would.<br/><br/>- Actually, the entire camp should go.<br/>- That would be awesome.<br/><br/>- Next.<br/>- Another beer.<br/><br/>Give me a refund on this bottle.<br/><br/>„Blood! Real blood!<br/><br/>It's crucial to make them feel<br/>self-sufficient in this situation.<br/><br/>We must avoid even a hint of<br/>imposing any activities upon them.<br/><br/>So, was my invitation<br/>one of these activities?<br/><br/>I am afraid, yes.<br/><br/>A hitchhiker. Should we stop?<br/><br/>We may, although we're almost there.<br/><br/>Get in.<br/><br/>To Budapest?<br/><br/>Hi. Good morning, professor.<br/><br/>How do you know I'm a teacher?<br/><br/>I used to attend your school,<br/>but I never took a class with you.<br/><br/>Where do you live now?<br/><br/>I moved not far from here<br/>after my parents’ divorce.<br/><br/>Son, why top having<br/>defected with pulling a hoax?<br/><br/>He ran away from our camp.<br/><br/>- Let me be! Stop! I want to get out.<br/>- Why did you escape?<br/><br/>Where have you been since yesterday?<br/><br/>Wherever.<br/><br/>Did you sleep in the forest?<br/><br/>What if I did?<br/><br/>- It must've been thrilling.<br/>- It sure was quite thrilling.<br/><br/>How about returning<br/>to the camp with us?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>Why not?<br/><br/>What for?<br/><br/>Sure.<br/><br/>It wouldn't fit the myth<br/>of your heroic escape, would it?<br/><br/>Why don't you take the train home?<br/><br/>Here, a 100 forint bill.<br/><br/>We'll drop you off at the station.<br/><br/>Here, take it!<br/><br/>You'll pay me back<br/>at school in September,<br/><br/>or you may mail it to me.<br/><br/>I can't repay that kind of money.<br/><br/>- All right. You must be starving.<br/>- I'm not hungry.<br/><br/>This is it. Let's stop here.<br/><br/>What's got into him?<br/><br/>I think it's better to let him go.<br/><br/>I certainly think it is.<br/><br/>Even if according to code he was<br/>supposed to be busted<br/><br/>and disciplined,<br/><br/>still, I'm sure I should let him go.<br/><br/>Maybe it was a mistake<br/>to offer him money,<br/><br/>but he's out there penniless,<br/><br/>it is my responsibility if<br/>he gets money another way.<br/><br/>Are they free to leave whenever<br/>they want?<br/><br/>I don't really understand your camp.<br/><br/>How come your Hungarian<br/>is this good?<br/><br/>I was seven when my family left.<br/><br/>Are you a teacher?<br/>What is your subject?<br/><br/>After finishing high school<br/>I was teaching for a year.<br/><br/>In an elementary school,<br/><br/>to save money for<br/>my university studies.<br/><br/>So, you're not a teacher.<br/>You don't have a degree.<br/><br/>I don't. I'm a student.<br/><br/>Then you have no specific knowledge<br/>of the French school system, have you?<br/><br/>I mean, you are not an expert.<br/><br/>Still, I can talk about it.<br/><br/>I don't mean to put you on the spot,<br/><br/>but your uncle told me<br/>you could give a talk,<br/><br/>to teach our kids that life is<br/>not that rosy there, either.<br/><br/>Please, stop here, I can walk<br/>from here. This dirt road is very bad.<br/><br/>Oh, not for this car.<br/><br/>Well, thanks for the ride.<br/><br/>I'm sorry you drove<br/>this far for nothing.<br/><br/>Oh, ce n'est rien!<br/><br/>But if I'm here already,<br/>I'd like to look around.<br/><br/>Excuse me,<br/><br/>I need to know for operations<br/>how long you intend to stay.<br/><br/>- A few days.<br/>- I see.<br/><br/>Welcome, then.<br/><br/>I'm extremely busy.<br/><br/>I see.<br/><br/>We'll find a bed for<br/>you in a teachers' tent.<br/><br/>I'll be fine on the grass<br/>with a blanket, you know.<br/><br/>Plunging in the lake is<br/>prohibited, it is manured.<br/><br/>It's a fish-pond.<br/><br/>Only soap could get<br/>all this dirt off.<br/><br/>Why can’t he have the<br/>vacant bed in our tent?<br/><br/>Come on, man!<br/><br/>What's the mileage?<br/><br/>118,000 kilometres.<br/><br/>You drove it all over<br/>Europe, didn't you?<br/><br/>Where are you going from here?<br/><br/>To Istanbul, for another month.<br/><br/>Istanbul, where else? Not bad.<br/><br/>Enough is as good as a feast.<br/><br/>Take cover!<br/><br/>What's this?<br/><br/>- Let me see!<br/>- What the fuck is this?<br/><br/>A cobblestone made out of rubber,<br/><br/>sold as a souvenir of<br/>the May barricades.<br/><br/>What May barricades?<br/><br/>Why the ones in May '68.<br/><br/>Someone made business of that, too.<br/><br/>Groovy, isn't it?<br/><br/>- Were you there on those barricades?<br/>- Yes, sure.<br/><br/>- Must've been a nice ruckus.<br/>- What does "ruckus" mean?<br/><br/>- Circus, mess.<br/>- I see.<br/><br/>Then later cobblestones<br/>were replaced.<br/><br/>The paving in Paris?<br/><br/>Yes, in the Quartier,<br/>the student quarter,<br/><br/>and then, to prevent<br/>it from happening again,<br/><br/>they covered the streets<br/>with bitumen.<br/><br/>Smart move.<br/><br/>Modernization.<br/>To advance things smoothly.<br/><br/>I don't mean to sound menacing,<br/><br/>but our street is still paved<br/>with good old cobblestones.<br/><br/>Made of Hungarian basalt.<br/><br/>Are you here to learn<br/>what to do next?<br/><br/>Is there something to learn here?<br/><br/>At least as much as in Istanbul.<br/><br/>Here goes the smartass again!<br/>He’s driving me nuts!<br/><br/>What do you want him to do?<br/><br/>Cancel his trip to Istanbul<br/>and rot here with us?<br/><br/>What the fuck is<br/>there to learn here?<br/><br/>At least he is free to drive<br/>his 2CV wherever he pleases.<br/><br/>One day you'll have a car, too,<br/>then you can drive to camping.<br/><br/>That's beside the point.<br/><br/>Do you know why Soporific<br/>doesn't want you here?<br/><br/>It has nothing to do with<br/>you not being a teacher.<br/><br/>I don't really understand<br/>what's going on here.<br/><br/>One day is certainly not<br/>enough to understand it.<br/><br/>- Who's this?<br/>- A teacher.<br/><br/>Hey, they've brought back Hasznos.<br/><br/>Come on! He's far away already,<br/>squatting somewhere.<br/><br/>Where have you been?<br/><br/>At the chicks. Are we in trouble?<br/><br/>Why would you be in trouble?<br/><br/>- No one knows we bolted?<br/>- Did you?<br/><br/>From the race we crossed<br/>the cornfield to the rails,<br/><br/>then we darted to the girls.<br/><br/>And? Anything happened?<br/><br/>There's no denial that<br/>some hanky-panky ensued.<br/><br/>Enough, man, I'll kick<br/>your ass back to the cornfield.<br/><br/>So, did you get laid, finally?<br/><br/>What's up? Did you steal a car?<br/><br/>Supposedly she's a<br/>teacher in the girls' camp.<br/><br/>Did they see you?<br/><br/>- Where are the others?<br/>- They left, I guess.<br/><br/>- They went to work?<br/>- Probably.<br/><br/>Get up, Kiddo!<br/><br/>But we agreed to go together.<br/><br/>- Where?<br/>- To hoe on the farm.<br/><br/>Why the big rush to leave?<br/><br/>- We don't matter, we're just dirt.<br/>- No way. Let's follow them!<br/><br/>Go, if you want.<br/><br/>You don't even know<br/>where they went.<br/><br/>Fuck you all!<br/><br/>Somebody say something!<br/>We're slaving like convicts.<br/><br/>Magyar men are guarded,<br/>pondering every word.<br/><br/>It's bacon &amp; onion time.<br/>Starvation's kicking in.<br/><br/>It's ludicrous how awkward<br/>we feel. Just think about it.<br/><br/>#1 It's absurd how we are<br/>digging away here<br/><br/>while the rest...<br/><br/>and we are here by choice, not force.<br/><br/>#2 We feel awkward about labour,<br/><br/>though we signed up to work<br/>in the first place.<br/><br/>#3 We mean to protest<br/>by working or what.<br/><br/>#4 We are protesting a way<br/>usually used to contain protesters.<br/><br/>#5 We feel weird about protesting<br/><br/>and it’s a joke that we protest<br/>all together.<br/><br/>#6 We feel weird about<br/>feeling weird, and anyway...<br/><br/>I can’t concentrate.<br/>Let me focus on my job!<br/><br/>Fellows, we are making progress!<br/>Can you feel labour’s dignifying power?<br/><br/>When looking back I'm<br/>tingling with pride.<br/><br/>You know what? Let's race.<br/><br/>The first to reach the end<br/>of the row will be awarded.<br/><br/>I won't disclose the<br/>nature of the award yet.<br/><br/>This is stupid. We're ludicrous.<br/><br/>It would be best to forget<br/>about the whole thing.<br/><br/>You’re going through<br/>temporary crisis. Get over it!<br/><br/>As your captain, I order<br/>you to resume working!<br/><br/>Suck it!<br/><br/>Why did you two join me?<br/><br/>Stop whining and shut up!<br/><br/>A shitload of chickens!<br/><br/>Had they joined us, it<br/>would be totally different.<br/><br/>Gutta cavat lapidem.<br/><br/>What do you mean?<br/><br/>I mean "the die is cast".<br/><br/>Hilarious.<br/><br/>Hic Rhodus, hic salta.<br/>but that's beside the point.<br/><br/>It's still better to be ludicrous<br/>than more ludicrous. You heard me.<br/><br/>- This is beyond me.<br/>- You see? Same here.<br/><br/>Come with me, you have<br/>nothing to do anyway.<br/><br/>Three more boys have bolted.<br/><br/>They left their belongings<br/>behind, though.<br/><br/>I have to cover for them<br/>to avoid another scandal.<br/><br/>I should prevent the others<br/>ratting on them.<br/><br/>I hope they'll be back by lunch.<br/><br/>Too bad.<br/><br/>You know, I don't have much time<br/><br/>and I'd like to see<br/>as much as possible.<br/><br/>We'll chat tonight, OK?<br/><br/>See you later.<br/><br/>I don't see why we’re going back.<br/><br/>I want to see what<br/>Soporific has in store for us.<br/><br/>I just want to know.<br/><br/>And to show off a teeny bit, right?<br/><br/>You should become a shrink.<br/><br/>What's he doing here?<br/><br/>- Hello. Are you headed to the camp?<br/>- Yes.<br/><br/>- Get in.<br/>- We're in no rush.<br/><br/>- Are you the three fugitives?<br/>- Fugitives my ass.<br/><br/>Who told you we’ve bolted?<br/><br/>The young teacher did, this morning.<br/><br/>Do you know where we went?<br/><br/>No. I went for a hike.<br/>So, where have you been?<br/><br/>You’ll never guess. We went to hoe.<br/><br/>To hoe?<br/><br/>To hoe on a farmer's land.<br/><br/>The old man hired us and we went.<br/><br/>We went because we’ve been<br/>Rotting in the camp for a week.<br/><br/>You mean you were fed up with doing<br/>nothing when you signed up to work.<br/><br/>That's it. Well said.<br/><br/>And now you're on your<br/>way back to the camp?<br/><br/>Why, what should we do?<br/>Work as day labourers?<br/><br/>Or go home to Budapest?<br/><br/>Well, actually, I don't really know,<br/><br/>I’m just curious about your plans,<br/><br/>if you will go back to work, or you<br/>want to organize a demonstration?<br/><br/>Demonstration?<br/><br/>Do you have something in mind?<br/><br/>Well, it’s hard to tell.<br/><br/>One should know the situation better.<br/><br/>An option would be to manifest,<br/>to hold an assemblé générale<br/><br/>I mean, to organize a<br/>meeting and draft a manifesto.<br/><br/>It happened for instance...<br/><br/>...sequestren le patron...<br/><br/>"lock up the boss"<br/><br/>they locked up the boss in his office,<br/><br/>without food,<br/><br/>he wasn’t even allowed to go to pee<br/><br/>until their demands were met.<br/><br/>Is that all?<br/><br/>Well, maybe you may try to<br/>initiate a dialog with farmers.<br/><br/>Did others mean to work, too,<br/><br/>or was this just a partisan action?<br/><br/>This was a "partisan action",<br/><br/>or not even that.<br/><br/>You're quite "resigné".<br/><br/>You don’t seem to have much<br/>faith in it.<br/><br/>- Faith in what? - What does<br/>faith have to do with this?<br/><br/>Why did you go to work then?<br/><br/>Why, why.<br/><br/>It's no big deal. The old man<br/>hired us we went, end of story.<br/><br/>If this is the end of the<br/>story then let’s forget it.<br/><br/>Don't sweat it. This is it.<br/>It's over. It hasn't even started.<br/><br/>Don’t bother to try,<br/>you'll never understand.<br/><br/>You’re on your way<br/>out of here to Istanbul.<br/><br/>It's not worth contemplating<br/>that we may be right.<br/><br/>From where you are, we<br/>don’t prove or disprove anything.<br/><br/>Why are you saying this?<br/><br/>Never mind.<br/><br/>You should have told me earlier.<br/><br/>In any case, if they are gone,<br/><br/>the official version is that<br/>we've sent them home. Is that clear?<br/><br/>- What about their belongings?<br/>- I don’t know. I couldn't care less.<br/><br/>They might have left<br/>with the Frenchman.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>Are you sure?<br/><br/>I am. I saw him leaving alone.<br/><br/>What if they cooked up some<br/>scheme? Anything is possible.<br/><br/>Dialog in a silent movie,<br/><br/>Black silence in the night,<br/><br/>Break in a pulse,<br/><br/>Somehow add up to who I am.<br/><br/>Love in a teaspoon,<br/><br/>kid in a freshly turned bed,<br/><br/>Warmth in a winter coat,<br/><br/>somewhere add up to who I am.<br/><br/>Do you know, young girl<br/><br/>What I hope for<br/><br/>What I hope for<br/>when you get close to me?<br/><br/>Do you know, young girl<br/><br/>What I hope for<br/><br/>What I hope for<br/>when you get close to me?<br/><br/>Chicken in an incubator,<br/><br/>Wit in a eulogy,<br/><br/>Round in a square<br/><br/>Somehow add up to who I am.<br/><br/>Dialog in a silent movie,<br/><br/>Black silence in the night,<br/><br/>Break in a pulse,<br/><br/>Somehow add up to who I am.<br/><br/>Do you know, young girl<br/><br/>what I hope for<br/><br/>what I hope for<br/>when you get close to me?<br/><br/>Do you know, young girl<br/><br/>what I hope for<br/><br/>what I hope for<br/>when you get close to me?<br/><br/>It's time for intermission.<br/><br/>For bourgies this is<br/>the time to mingle.<br/><br/>You can't even fathom the seriousness<br/>of your act under the circumstances.<br/><br/>Actually, I get your point,<br/><br/>to some extent I even agree with you.<br/><br/>But you must grant<br/><br/>that I’m doing the right thing<br/>when expelling you.<br/><br/>Your punishment may<br/>be disproportionate,<br/><br/>but you should acknowledge that<br/><br/>a precedent must be set for<br/>the rest.<br/><br/>I'll do my best to iron it<br/>out at school in the fall.<br/><br/>Who is it?<br/><br/>Wait outside, please.<br/><br/>So, this is the state of things.<br/><br/>Well, what do you think?<br/><br/>Can we still stay if<br/>we pass on this deal?<br/><br/>No! Now I can see that<br/>I made the right decision.<br/><br/>Your act is nothing but frivolous<br/>trouble-making I'm stunned to see<br/><br/>a person entrusted with serious<br/>responsibilities be part of it.<br/><br/>You respond with sheer insolence<br/>to being fully provided here!<br/><br/>You get room and board, activities<br/>and all that doesn't come free,<br/><br/>doesn't just grow like weed.<br/><br/>If this is how you respond, be it!<br/><br/>You’re out of here<br/>first thing in the morning.<br/><br/>I’m done.<br/><br/>I was thinking of punching him<br/>in the face,<br/><br/>just like that, slapping him.<br/><br/>That would have been a bad idea.<br/><br/>I think it's awesome you<br/>didn't do any of the sort.<br/><br/>Otherwise you would have<br/>provided them with an argument..<br/><br/>Then you would have lost<br/>purity, morally speaking.<br/><br/>Who cares? Who gives<br/>a fuck about purity here?<br/><br/>I am going to explode!<br/><br/>How did they find out that we left?<br/><br/>I should have asked him<br/>at least that.<br/><br/>Let's do something, or it will be<br/>deflated to a petty disciplinary case,<br/><br/>that we, too, just try<br/>to get away with.<br/><br/>What else do you want?<br/><br/>What’s your problem? Is it<br/>really that we don't have to slave?<br/><br/>That should be your worst<br/>headache ever.<br/><br/>That's irrelevant.<br/><br/>The cause has no mass<br/>support, that's the problem.<br/><br/>We have nothing to lose<br/>anymore, but the rest.<br/><br/>I don't give a fuck about<br/>what the rest has to lose! OK?<br/><br/>Look at the misunderstood hero!<br/><br/>Do you expect a monument<br/>dedicated to you?<br/><br/>Why did you let go that runaway boy?<br/><br/>He is a difficult case. You saw<br/>for yourself how stubborn he was.<br/><br/>And what did these boys have<br/>to say about being expelled?<br/><br/>These are smart, reasonable boys.<br/><br/>I told them I am supportive,<br/><br/>in a similar situation I even<br/>may have acted similarly,<br/><br/>but discipline is in the<br/>best interest of the community.<br/><br/>What if tomorrow not<br/>just three, but ten of them<br/><br/>and after tomorrow half<br/>of the camp chose to bolt?<br/><br/>Not to work, but just go<br/>anywhere they feel like!<br/><br/>Don’t you think all of<br/>them are devoted to work.<br/><br/>These three accepted it<br/>without any grudge,<br/><br/>without any grudge,<br/><br/>as reasonable adults should.<br/><br/>So can you expel students without<br/>discussing it with the rest of the camp?<br/><br/>What makes you think you<br/>have the right to challenge me?<br/><br/>I will not tolerate any meddling<br/><br/>with matters at my sole discretion.<br/><br/>You don't have the foggiest<br/>idea what this country is about.<br/><br/>These boys don't need<br/>any foreigners' protection.<br/><br/>They know what is<br/>the right thing to do.<br/><br/>5...<br/><br/>6...<br/><br/>7...<br/><br/>8...<br/><br/>9...<br/><br/>10...<br/><br/>11...<br/><br/>12...<br/><br/>13...<br/><br/>14...<br/><br/>15...<br/><br/>16...<br/><br/>17...<br/><br/>18...<br/><br/>19...<br/><br/>20...<br/><br/>21...<br/><br/>22...<br/><br/>23...<br/><br/>24...<br/><br/>25...<br/><br/>26...<br/><br/>27...<br/><br/>28...<br/><br/>29...<br/><br/>30...<br/><br/>31...<br/><br/>32...<br/><br/>33...<br/><br/>34...<br/><br/>35...<br/><br/>36...<br/><br/>37...<br/><br/>38...<br/><br/>39...<br/><br/>40...<br/><br/>41...<br/><br/>42...<br/><br/>43...<br/><br/>44...<br/><br/>45...<br/><br/>46...<br/><br/>47...<br/><br/>48...<br/><br/>49...<br/><br/>50...<br/><br/>51...<br/><br/>52...<br/><br/>53...<br/><br/>54...<br/><br/>55...<br/><br/>56...<br/><br/>57...<br/><br/>58...<br/><br/>59...<br/><br/>60...<br/><br/>61...<br/><br/>62...<br/><br/>63...<br/><br/>Line up for hoisting the flag!<br/><br/>Please, give me permission<br/>to see those three boys home.<br/><br/>I'm worried they may<br/>end up doing something silly.<br/><br/>It is out of the question.<br/><br/>You'll see them to the<br/>train station, that's it.<br/><br/>You better help me<br/>to round up this pack!<br/><br/>Some of you, so it seems,<br/>are not mature enough…<br/><br/>for the self-governance-<br/>based community-life<br/><br/>that we started to<br/>establish in this camp.<br/><br/>I have to stress that I am<br/>talking about only a few people.<br/><br/>I trust the majority<br/>identifies with our intentions.<br/><br/>Hence, I won't implement<br/>any retaliatory measures,<br/><br/>I don't intend to mar the healthy<br/>atmosphere we created in this camp.<br/><br/>However, increased rigor<br/>will be implemented against<br/><br/>those immature and<br/>disruptive individuals<br/><br/>who attempt to undermine<br/>our efforts.<br/><br/>Those three of your fellow campers,<br/><br/>who left camp without<br/>authorization yesterday,<br/><br/>have been banished from our camp.<br/><br/>Disciplinary action will follow<br/>at the beginning of the academic year.<br/><br/>We'll raise the flag now!<br/><br/>From now on, the flag will<br/>be hoisted every morning,<br/><br/>and lowered at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Hoists of the flag will be<br/>preceded by daily announcements.<br/><br/>At attention!<br/><br/>Look up Hasznos as<br/>soon as you get home.<br/><br/>Find him somehow<br/>in case he didn't go home.<br/><br/>I mean, find him before...<br/><br/>before we may lose him for good.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me, I am not<br/>trying to pass on my responsibility.<br/><br/>I am asking you because<br/>he thinks he has nothing to lose.<br/><br/>I know his family situation and...<br/><br/>he doesn’t care much<br/>about what he does and why.<br/><br/>Maybe he will listen to you,<br/><br/>and you know, or at least you try<br/>to figure out what you do and why.<br/><br/>Also, you understand that<br/>his reaction is not viable.<br/><br/>This camp took an unfortunate turn,<br/><br/>but now you have a chance<br/>to do something really sensible.<br/><br/>Bye.<br/><br/>Does he expect us to<br/>comb the entire country?<br/><br/>He doesn’t.<br/><br/>Excuse me, may we open the<br/>window? There’s a lot of smoke.<br/><br/>I wouldn't mind,<br/>but it is not possible.<br/><br/>May we open the door then?<br/><br/>Sure, but it slips back.<br/><br/>Let's go to another compartment.<br/><br/>Feel free, I will not be offended.<br/><br/>Let's block it.</div>
