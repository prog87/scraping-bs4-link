The implication<br/>is, you reap what you sow.<br/><br/>We are simply delivering it back to them<br/><br/>and saying, "We don't want this."<br/><br/>The letter was from an unknown group<br/>called the Dark Harvest Commandos,<br/><br/>and their first target was<br/>this secret research facility<br/><br/>in Wiltshire.<br/><br/>Inside this ordinary-looking building,<br/><br/>scientists work with some of<br/>the most dangerous substances<br/><br/>in the world. It's Porton Down,<br/><br/>the Ministry of Defence's<br/>chemical defence establishment.<br/><br/>Porton Down was one of the most<br/>secretive places in Britain,<br/><br/>and was closely guarded.<br/><br/>They were on the alert,<br/>and they did an initial search<br/><br/>of their premises and found nothing.<br/><br/>They checked again, and this bucket<br/>was found outside the perimeter.<br/><br/>The bucket was filled with soil,<br/><br/>but according to their letter,<br/><br/>this soil also contained a<br/>deadly agent of germ warfare.<br/><br/>Bacillus anthracis.<br/><br/>Better known as "anthrax".<br/><br/>A Government minister said today<br/>that the whole country had been<br/><br/>put at risk as the result of an<br/>environmentalist group's protest.<br/><br/>The group dumped a sample of soil,<br/>which they claimed<br/><br/>was contaminated with anthrax,<br/>near the perimeter<br/><br/>of the Porton Down biological<br/>research station, in Wiltshire.<br/><br/>First thing that they did is deny it.<br/><br/>They said it's a hoax,<br/><br/>it's not really anything<br/>to alarm the public about,<br/><br/>there's no public risk here.<br/><br/>Those scientists at the<br/>station are conducting tests<br/><br/>on the package of soil.<br/><br/>We understand that they<br/>think it's very unlikely<br/><br/>that there's any anthrax in the sample.<br/><br/>Anthrax is a naturally<br/>occurring but deadly organism.<br/><br/>In the Bible, it was one of<br/>the ten plagues of Egypt,<br/><br/>and any outbreak can<br/>have fatal consequences.<br/><br/>The bacterium forms spores.<br/><br/>If they're in the air<br/>and you breathe them in<br/><br/>and they get into your respiratory<br/>system or get into your lungs,<br/><br/>the little seeds will<br/>germinate into bacteria,<br/><br/>the bacteria will start to grow,<br/><br/>and then they start producing nasty<br/>things which will cause you to die.<br/><br/>It's pretty lethal.<br/><br/>On the skin, blisters,<br/>often with very black spots,<br/><br/>look very ugly.<br/><br/>Swellings, flu-like symptoms -<br/>you're getting the whole works.<br/><br/>You're getting nausea,<br/>you're getting hoarseness,<br/><br/>you're getting bloody vomit,<br/>abdominal pains,<br/><br/>bloody diarrhoea, septicaemia, meningitis.<br/><br/>Some pretty horrific<br/>ways to die from anthrax.<br/><br/>In a rabbit, symptoms<br/>will appear in about 18 hours.<br/><br/>In a man, about 24. In a child,<br/>perhaps a little sooner.<br/><br/>If you can imagine the tissues swelling.<br/><br/>You start bleeding<br/><br/>from the inside out,<br/>so it's really quite unpleasant.<br/><br/>The suspect soil that<br/>the Dark Harvest protesters left<br/><br/>outside Porton Down was brought<br/>into the facility for analysis,<br/><br/>and Government scientists<br/>quickly established<br/><br/>it came from over 600 miles away.<br/><br/>Gruinard Island...<br/><br/>..sitting just a<br/>mile from the mainland<br/><br/>in the far northwest of the British Isles.<br/><br/>It's a place that holds many secrets.<br/><br/>I've come a long way to visit<br/>that island lying out there<br/><br/>in its lonely sea loch.<br/><br/>Hereabouts, they call it the<br/>Island of Death, the Mystery Island.<br/><br/>But in the years before<br/>the Second World War,<br/><br/>Gruinard Bay was a peaceful place.<br/><br/>The island had been<br/>uninhabited since the Clearances,<br/><br/>but was overlooked by a<br/>scattering of mainland villages,<br/><br/>which in the pre-tourist era were home<br/><br/>to God-fearing, Gaelic-speaking<br/>crofter folk.<br/><br/>Now, this is not a story of old, dark deeds<br/><br/>or Highland superstition.<br/><br/>No, this story started in 1942.<br/><br/>In the early years of the Second World War,<br/><br/>the Northwest Highlands were<br/>strategically important -<br/><br/>sparsely populated and<br/>far away from enemy eyes.<br/><br/>The British Army arrived in droves.<br/><br/>There were battleships in the bay,<br/><br/>armoured cars in the ditches<br/><br/>and a warm welcome in the villages<br/>of Laide, Aultbea,<br/><br/>Gairloch and Ullapool.<br/><br/>The area was changed<br/>completely during the war years.<br/><br/>A huge amount of activity.<br/>I mean, as a kid,<br/><br/>you loved seeing all the<br/>things that were happening.<br/><br/>Soldiers crawling everywhere.<br/><br/>Operations on the island<br/>were shrouded in secrecy,<br/><br/>and the locals were kept at a distance.<br/><br/>It was secretive. We knew there<br/>was something going on there.<br/><br/>And there was a barrier across the road,<br/><br/>people in white suits going to the island.<br/><br/>There was that feeling that<br/>there was things happening,<br/><br/>that people weren't sure what was going on.<br/><br/>I was working on the farm along<br/>there, opposite the island,<br/><br/>and I was seeing them back and forth<br/><br/>with the cattle and the sheep.<br/><br/>They ferried them right<br/>across to the island.<br/><br/>What were these scientists up<br/>to on the island, do you think?<br/><br/>I couldn't very well tell<br/>you what they were up to.<br/><br/>I was seven or eight.<br/><br/>We were going to Ullapool<br/>in the car, passing the island...<br/><br/>..and when we came to Gruinard,<br/>there were sort of puffs in the air.<br/><br/>A few little explosions going off.<br/><br/>But just on this near the part<br/>of the island, on this side,<br/><br/>there were several of them,<br/><br/>and they were little<br/>sort of puffs in the air.<br/><br/>What on earth is it?<br/>What are they doing there?<br/><br/>There were rumours and whispers about<br/><br/>what might be going on on the island,<br/><br/>but over on the mainland,<br/>disturbing things began to happen.<br/><br/>My brother went out about<br/>eight o'clock in the morning.<br/><br/>First of all, he went to the barn,<br/><br/>and he found one of<br/>the cows dead in the stall.<br/><br/>He came in to tell my father.<br/><br/>Then he went down to the hill<br/>to have a look at the sheep,<br/><br/>and he found eight dead.<br/><br/>Follow me.<br/><br/>This is the community church in Aultbea.<br/><br/>Please come in.<br/><br/>Danny Grant is an elder<br/>in the local church.<br/><br/>As a child, he witnessed<br/>something he'll never forget.<br/><br/>I actually saw it with my own eyes -<br/><br/>a big horse dumped in<br/>this hole, with the legs...<br/><br/>Rigour mortis had set in, so that...<br/><br/>I remember having to cut...<br/>They cut the legs off the horse.<br/><br/>That wasn't a very pretty thing<br/>for children to be watching,<br/><br/>but we all...<br/>I remember seeing this.<br/><br/>And then telling the adults about<br/>all they sheep lying in the fields<br/><br/>with their legs in the air,<br/>and they're all dead.<br/><br/>Maybe a dozen or more.<br/><br/>Within hours, I believe,<br/>they were finding cows.<br/><br/>And people were obviously alarmed.<br/><br/>I lost one horse, and I<br/>lost six or seven sheep.<br/><br/>Now, what happened to these animals?<br/>Have you any idea at all?<br/><br/>Well, I'm sure they would be poisoned.<br/><br/>Scientists at Porton Down in Wiltshire<br/><br/>are carrying out tests<br/>on the package of soil<br/><br/>contaminated with anthrax spores,<br/><br/>which was dumped at the<br/>chemical defence establishment<br/><br/>by a Scottish protest group.<br/><br/>It's taken three days of tests here<br/>at the public health laboratories<br/><br/>to confirm that anthrax<br/>spores were in the soil,<br/><br/>which was dumped on the perimeter<br/><br/>of the Government's defence establishment.<br/><br/>We've shown that there<br/>is anthrax in the soil.<br/><br/>It could be dangerous, but under<br/>very unusual circumstances.<br/><br/>It would have to get in<br/>through a cut in the skin,<br/><br/>and that would be very unlikely.<br/><br/>The Government seemed very<br/>keen to play down any danger,<br/><br/>but the story was now front-page news.<br/><br/>Public attitude changed at that<br/>point, and the media as well.<br/><br/>It suddenly became a really serious<br/>thing because anthrax,<br/><br/>you know, this stuff is dangerous.<br/><br/>The MOD scientists knew<br/>very well how dangerous.<br/><br/>Dark Harvest had targeted<br/>Porton Down for a reason.<br/><br/>"Where better to send our seeds of death<br/><br/>"than to the place<br/>from whence they came?"<br/><br/>With the war on a knife edge,<br/><br/>Churchill feared the Nazis<br/>had developed a biological bomb,<br/><br/>so he tasked his team of top scientists<br/><br/>with finding ways to<br/>harness anthrax as a weapon.<br/><br/>This was highly secretive.<br/><br/>You can get all sorts of<br/>different strains of anthrax,<br/><br/>but this was one of<br/>the more potent strains.<br/><br/>Some of the moral<br/>equivocations of peacetime<br/><br/>had to be put to one side<br/>just to see the potency<br/><br/>and potential of this<br/>form of weapon system.<br/><br/>To see whether this particular strain<br/><br/>would have the effects they expected.<br/><br/>What they didn't know, of<br/>course, was what would happen<br/><br/>if they were trialled in more<br/>realistic field conditions.<br/><br/>They had to find a testing site<br/>that was remote, uninhabited,<br/><br/>isolated but accessible from the mainland.<br/><br/>And that's where you bring<br/>the story up to Gruinard.<br/><br/>Wartime scientists carefully<br/>packaged their weaponised anthrax<br/><br/>and headed 600 miles north.<br/><br/>Transporting this was a risk in itself.<br/><br/>It's a long, long way from Porton,<br/><br/>but it's also a long, long way from<br/><br/>people who could be affected<br/>by an accidental downwind<br/><br/>draft of anthrax spores.<br/><br/>A beautiful and uninhabited little island<br/><br/>was about to witness one of the<br/>first weapons of mass destruction.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways, this island is<br/>the key to some of the big secrets<br/><br/>and what ifs of 20th century history.<br/><br/>It was here in 1942<br/><br/>that the very first scientifically<br/>controlled BW field trials<br/><br/>were carried out.<br/><br/>You have the UK using the Highlands<br/>as a base of operations<br/><br/>for war on a scale that people<br/>hadn't comprehended before.<br/><br/>You're seeing on this seemingly<br/>uninteresting island<br/><br/>the beginning of a kind of<br/>terrifying military power<br/><br/>that was just as great as nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>There were no facilities<br/>anywhere for these tests,<br/><br/>which were, of course, much more hazardous<br/><br/>than comparable chemical warfare trials,<br/><br/>and so this island was picked<br/>especially for its isolation.<br/><br/>What actually happened on Gruinard Island<br/><br/>was a source of mystery and<br/>rumour until the declassification<br/><br/>of this extraordinary MOD film,<br/><br/>which captured every<br/>detail in technicolour.<br/><br/>The sheep are being<br/>put into exposure crates.<br/><br/>The crate is necessary to hold<br/>the animal in the right place<br/><br/>on the layout and to ensure<br/>that it faces the cloud.<br/><br/>It's an incredible historical document,<br/><br/>the cutting edge of science,<br/><br/>and they're documenting<br/>it as they go along,<br/><br/>step by step, so that potentially<br/>they could do this again in future,<br/><br/>somewhere else.<br/><br/>The ambition was to develop<br/>a frightening new weapon -<br/><br/>an anthrax bomb.<br/><br/>It is quite a chilling film.<br/><br/>The aim was to test,<br/>first, whether the anthrax<br/><br/>would survive explosion in the field.<br/><br/>They didn't know that.<br/><br/>And then, would it remain<br/>virulent thereafter?<br/><br/>The men wear ordinary cloth<br/>overalls, rubber boots and gloves,<br/><br/>a respirator with particulate filter<br/><br/>and a cloth hood to keep the hair clean<br/><br/>and reduce risk of leaks.<br/><br/>One of the men in the protective<br/>suits was Allan Elton Younger.<br/><br/>Anthrax is almost indestructible.<br/><br/>Therefore, it was perhaps the best<br/>organism to stand up to the blast.<br/><br/>80-odd sheep were<br/>tethered at various stages<br/><br/>downwind of the likely explosion.<br/><br/>The explosion was done by remote control.<br/><br/>And you see them all lined up.<br/><br/>The bomb was fired<br/>and the wind carries the cloud<br/><br/>towards the line of animals and impingers.<br/><br/>Oh, there we go.<br/><br/>This tiny moment, this puff<br/>of powder, and it really is,<br/><br/>it's releasing death.<br/><br/>It isn't a great bang -<br/>a draft of highly potent spores<br/><br/>moving down on the wind and<br/>causing infection and death<br/><br/>wherever it goes.<br/><br/>They sent up clouds of<br/>bacillus spores into the air,<br/><br/>the sheep inhaled them, and then<br/>they observed the sheep<br/><br/>to see how quickly they died.<br/><br/>On the third day after<br/>exposure, the casualties begin.<br/><br/>Dead sheep can be seen<br/>further down the line.<br/><br/>Also watching from nearby<br/>shores were local crofters.<br/><br/>Did you ever see anything?<br/><br/>Well, I used to watch the smoke<br/><br/>coming down on the top of them.<br/><br/>What do you mean "the smoke"?<br/><br/>Was it a cloud of...?<br/><br/>A cloud rolling above<br/>the Earth... Uh-huh.<br/><br/>..coming towards these animals.<br/><br/>Where were the animals?<br/><br/>They were staked over there.<br/><br/>I see, they were tied up in a<br/>line, were they? Yes, in a line.<br/><br/>I've heard it said that some<br/>people did see these animals<br/><br/>falling dead when this cloud hit them.<br/><br/>Well, I'm sure I did<br/>the same. Did you?<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>All the sheep in the cloud died.<br/><br/>Postmortem is usually carried<br/>out to confirm appearances.<br/><br/>One useful feature of this<br/>operating theatre is running water.<br/><br/>There's a little waterfall close by.<br/><br/>I think, had I been living<br/>locally, I would've...<br/><br/>..been very anxious to<br/>hear about it. You know,<br/><br/>there's live anthrax being released<br/>less than a mile from your home,<br/><br/>from your farm, I think is<br/>enormously anxiety inducing.<br/><br/>Infected sheep carcasses were burnt<br/><br/>or buried under tonnes of rubble...<br/><br/>..when a cliff on<br/>the island was blown up.<br/><br/>The experiment was deemed a success,<br/><br/>and in 1943, the scientists packed<br/>up and returned to Porton Down...<br/><br/>..but the anthrax remained.<br/><br/>The examination of<br/>soil samples from the layout<br/><br/>showed heavy contamination.<br/><br/>It soon became clear that the contamination<br/><br/>wasn't confined to the island.<br/><br/>A message came down from here that<br/>there had been a case of anthrax,<br/><br/>and that we were suspected.<br/>And this came in clear,<br/><br/>and of course, the great secret,<br/>as far as we were concerned...<br/><br/>I mean, we were told not<br/>to talk about this at all,<br/><br/>and particularly anthrax<br/>must never be mentioned.<br/><br/>And this signal came in clear,<br/><br/>which horrified all of us.<br/><br/>On the mainland, in the six<br/>months after the experiments,<br/><br/>between 30 and 50 sheep, seven cows,<br/><br/>two horses and three cats died.<br/><br/>Government officials promptly<br/>paid compensation to crofters<br/><br/>and persuaded them that the<br/>anthrax infection had come ashore<br/><br/>when a carcass was dumped<br/>from a passing Greek ship.<br/><br/>Porton Down dispatched two men<br/>to Gruinard in another attempt<br/><br/>to rid the island of spores.<br/><br/>We've gone with all our equipment<br/>and just set fire to the heather,<br/><br/>which, by that evening,<br/>was burning right over the island,<br/><br/>a huge cloud of smoke.<br/><br/>Churchill's anthrax bomb was never used.<br/><br/>By the end of the war,<br/><br/>Gruinard had been poisoned,<br/>burned and abandoned.<br/><br/>As months turned to years,<br/>and years to decades,<br/><br/>the deadly spores remained.<br/><br/>The contamination has continued very heavy<br/><br/>over all these years,<br/><br/>and we might have to wait as long<br/>as 100 years for it to get clear.<br/><br/>You don't get any trouble now, of course,<br/><br/>from this long-ago affair, do you?<br/><br/>Well, yes. In this particular<br/>place, yes, I lose sheep,<br/><br/>you know, in the spring.<br/><br/>It wasn't until 24 years<br/>after the experiment<br/><br/>that the warning signs<br/>even mentioned anthrax.<br/><br/>Generations of Highlanders<br/><br/>grew up in the shadow<br/>of the Forbidden Island.<br/><br/>They didn't know exactly<br/>what happened on Gruinard,<br/><br/>but they were warned they must never<br/>set foot on the Island of Death.<br/><br/>Let me get this light on here.<br/><br/>But every year, one local made the<br/>short journey across Gruinard Bay.<br/><br/>'83, '82.<br/><br/>'81.<br/><br/>Every January, we had to go<br/>out and bolt these ones on.<br/><br/>'85, '86, '87, '88...<br/><br/>The island is still so<br/>heavily contaminated with anthrax<br/><br/>that anyone wanting to land<br/>there needs a protective suit<br/><br/>and a seven-and-a-half<br/>month course of injections.<br/><br/>The sign just was to stop people landing.<br/><br/>Anywhere you could possibly get<br/>a boat ashore, there's a sign.<br/><br/>It was under experiment<br/>and landing was prohibited.<br/><br/>My great, great, great grandfather<br/>was born on the island.<br/><br/>When I always hear it<br/>being dubbed Anthrax Island,<br/><br/>I kind of feel, well, there was<br/>something happened there before.<br/><br/>There were people there before,<br/>living there before.<br/><br/>There's no written documents,<br/><br/>so it was just snippets of<br/>oral history that's come down.<br/><br/>They would've been cleared off the island.<br/><br/>They were forced out of their homes,<br/>like most people were back then.<br/><br/>If you say that an island is forbidden,<br/><br/>I think it does come with a<br/>sort of perverse fascination.<br/><br/>This idea that the ground is poisoned<br/><br/>and that it might be<br/>dangerous for you to be there<br/><br/>all adds to that sense<br/>of taboo, of forbiddeness.<br/><br/>There is some kind of<br/>legendary aspect, I think,<br/><br/>to the concept of the toxic island,<br/><br/>the poisoned island, that we all tap into,<br/><br/>and it has some kind<br/>of psychological power.<br/><br/>We were never warned, we were<br/>just told not to go up on the land.<br/><br/>Just stay on the shore.<br/><br/>It was less than £200 a year.<br/><br/>To go to Anthrax Island?<br/>Aye. Yeah. Yep.<br/><br/>It was a lot of money in them days to us.<br/><br/>Yeah. Yeah.<br/><br/>Four decades passed, and<br/>Gruinard was still not safe.<br/><br/>Can you foresee a time when<br/>the island will be free<br/><br/>for people to land on?<br/><br/>No. The spores are surprisingly<br/>resistant to degradation.<br/><br/>Indeed, that was one<br/>of the reasons for them<br/><br/>being selected in the first place.<br/><br/>And we would expect there to<br/>be an area of contamination<br/><br/>for the next tens, perhaps<br/>even hundreds of years.<br/><br/>Four days after bringing infected<br/>Gruinard soil to Porton Down,<br/><br/>the Dark Harvest Commandos<br/>were to strike again.<br/><br/>"That we still have the<br/>problem to worry about today<br/><br/>"is due to 40 years of<br/>total official indifference.<br/><br/>"That's indifference<br/>is about to end."<br/><br/>The Conservative Party conference of 1981<br/><br/>was held in Blackpool<br/>amidst tight security.<br/><br/>But it wasn't only<br/>Thatcher, Heseltine and Heath<br/><br/>making headlines by the sea...<br/><br/>At Blackpool this afternoon,<br/><br/>a second suspect package was found.<br/><br/>It was left in the Tower<br/>buildings near where<br/><br/>the Conservative conference is being held.<br/><br/>The Blackpool Tower was closed<br/>to the public after the discovery<br/><br/>of a tin box believed to<br/>contain soil contaminated...<br/><br/>And the oil, contained in a tin box,<br/><br/>was sent to Porton Down for analysis.<br/><br/>This was found behind a locked door,<br/>and somebody had somehow managed<br/><br/>to get in to that door during normal<br/>operational hours of the tower.<br/><br/>Two packages in five days<br/>meant that this was a campaign.<br/><br/>The letter to the newspapers had claimed<br/><br/>that 300lbs of soil had been taken,<br/><br/>enough for many more attacks.<br/><br/>So this was very alarming. Raising<br/>the prospect of massive escalations<br/><br/>of this contaminated soil was a huge issue.<br/><br/>The MOD considered putting<br/>soldiers on Gruinard to protect it.<br/><br/>They considered sending a<br/>gunboat to patrol the waters<br/><br/>or stationing police on<br/>the shore to keep guard.<br/><br/>But securing Gruinard<br/>seemed next to impossible.<br/><br/>They needed to catch those responsible.<br/><br/>A general alert was<br/>issued throughout the UK,<br/><br/>and a special taskforce<br/>was formed to track down<br/><br/>the Dark Harvest Commandos.<br/><br/>At the time I was based in Inverness,<br/><br/>I was instructed to go and deal with it.<br/><br/>Detective Inspector Colin MacDonald<br/><br/>followed the winding Highland roads<br/><br/>to Gruinard Bay and<br/>the tiny village of Laide.<br/><br/>And I found it quite difficult.<br/><br/>It was a close-knit community,<br/><br/>and they didn't want to<br/>say anything, sometimes,<br/><br/>in case they said too much.<br/><br/>That's the only way that<br/>you could describe them.<br/><br/>At the local post office,<br/><br/>the police found a petition calling<br/>for the clean-up of the island.<br/><br/>One name was of particular interest.<br/><br/>The campaign organiser, John Alick MacRae.<br/><br/>I was involved in<br/>getting this list of names<br/><br/>to draw attention to<br/>the fact that human beings<br/><br/>were surrounding the island.<br/><br/>They wanted to know who<br/>had initiated in the list,<br/><br/>and that is when I was interviewed.<br/><br/>Declassified Government<br/>documents that have lain unnoticed<br/><br/>in the National Archives for over a decade<br/><br/>reveal John Alick was indeed a suspect.<br/><br/>"By way of confidential background,<br/><br/>"the Minister may like to know<br/>that the local Scottish police<br/><br/>"have a strong suspicion that Mr MacRae,<br/><br/>"the organiser of the petition,<br/><br/>"was party to the action<br/>of the Dark Harvest group."<br/><br/>They were convinced because<br/>they suspected a local.<br/><br/>But there were other locals<br/>living close to the island<br/><br/>who had already carried out covert<br/>operations that made headline news.<br/><br/>Here in the vaults of Gairloch Museum,<br/><br/>they hold evidence that<br/>connected one local woman<br/><br/>to a very similar caper.<br/><br/>I've got letter here to<br/>Kay Matheson from the stonemason<br/><br/>who repaired the Stone of Destiny.<br/><br/>You know, it was broken in two<br/>whenever it was stolen.<br/><br/>On Christmas morning, the stone was gone.<br/><br/>The Dean of Westminster<br/>called the disappearance<br/><br/>an act of sacrilege<br/><br/>and spoke of the stone as a precious relic<br/><br/>treasured by millions throughout<br/>the British Commonwealth.<br/><br/>Kay Matheson is from the local area,<br/><br/>became involved with a group of students<br/><br/>who were also passionate<br/>Scottish nationalists.<br/><br/>A nationwide search was organised.<br/><br/>The police have issued the<br/>description of a man and woman<br/><br/>who were seen in a<br/>Ford Anglia car near the Abbey<br/><br/>in the small hours of Christmas morning.<br/><br/>So that was described by one journalist<br/><br/>as the greatest heist in history.<br/><br/>And of course, it was all<br/>over the papers at the time.<br/><br/>And Kay achieved great<br/>notoriety through that.<br/><br/>These initials, JFS, apparently<br/>newly scratched on the chair,<br/><br/>are thought to stand<br/>for Justice For Scotland,<br/><br/>and support the theory that<br/>the stone's disappearance<br/><br/>is the work of extreme<br/>Scottish nationalists.<br/><br/>Inevitably, the local woman<br/>who famously stole the stone<br/><br/>was suspected of stealing the soil.<br/><br/>She obviously had form in that sense,<br/><br/>and it wouldn't have been her<br/>first run-in with Special Branch.<br/><br/>She would have had strong feelings,<br/><br/>I think, about the British Government<br/><br/>using Scottish land in that way.<br/><br/>Behind closed croft doors,<br/><br/>locals speculated and gossiped<br/>about this Highland whodunnit,<br/><br/>but nobody was naming names,<br/><br/>and they still won't.<br/><br/>I think they thought a<br/>woman might be involved.<br/><br/>A well-known activist woman<br/>for other things.<br/><br/>She was definitely for<br/>the Highlands, for Gaelic,<br/><br/>for education.<br/><br/>Who was that?<br/><br/>I don't know if I can<br/>say much more than that.<br/><br/>We really went round<br/>nearly every house in Laide<br/><br/>to see if we could get anything,<br/>but it was a closed shop, really.<br/><br/>I felt that there was maybe<br/>more known in the community<br/><br/>than was being said.<br/><br/>And it was just an instinct.<br/><br/>The police weren't even allowed<br/>to go to Gruinard and inspect<br/><br/>the scene of the crime.<br/><br/>But one person who was<br/>authorised to visit the island<br/><br/>was boatman Stuart Flett.<br/><br/>'85, '86.<br/><br/>In his diary, he recorded<br/>an important breakthrough...<br/><br/>"Police probe new clue<br/>in Gruinard mystery."<br/><br/>..the raiders had used his boat.<br/><br/>It was chained to a tree in the wintertime.<br/><br/>The chain was broken, and a note saying,<br/><br/>"Sorry about the chain, thanks for<br/>the use of the boat - Dark Harvest."<br/><br/>The newly found note helped<br/>the police build up a better picture<br/><br/>of what happened,<br/><br/>and the letter to the newspapers<br/>spelled out in detail<br/><br/>why it happened.<br/><br/>"A team of microbiologists<br/>from two universities,<br/><br/>"guided by members of our local population,<br/><br/>"affected a landing on<br/>the island last week.<br/><br/>"A large number of soil samples<br/>from all over the island,<br/><br/>"with a total weight of 300lbs,<br/><br/>"were securely bagged and<br/>removed to the mainland.<br/><br/>"For the next 12 months,<br/>these bags will be deposited<br/><br/>"at appropriate points."<br/><br/>The really terrifying<br/>thing is that they say,<br/><br/>"This is just the start." This is<br/>just the start of a campaign,<br/><br/>and that's when I think the full machinery<br/><br/>of the Secret State would get into gear.<br/><br/>The mystery of who<br/>the Dark Harvest Commandos were<br/><br/>played out in a climate of Cold War<br/>paranoia and polarised politics.<br/><br/>The Ceilidh Place in Ullapool<br/>was a forum for the kind of debates<br/><br/>that radicals and left-wingers were having<br/><br/>throughout the 1980s in Scotland.<br/><br/>We do have to make sure that<br/>our view is clearly stated.<br/><br/>We are opposed to nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>We will eventually get rid of them.<br/><br/>People don't expect<br/><br/>any kind of hotbed of<br/>radicalism in the Highlands.<br/><br/>But they're wrong.<br/><br/>Jean Urquhart ran the Ceilidh Place<br/>and formed the local branch of CND.<br/><br/>As a prominent activist,<br/><br/>Jean was interviewed about Dark Harvest,<br/><br/>and it wasn't the local bobby<br/>asking the questions.<br/><br/>It was military police who came up,<br/>and we were quite taken aback.<br/><br/>We were quite naive because CND<br/>was seen as, you know,<br/><br/>as kind of the enemy of the state.<br/><br/>And of course, it's quite a different thing<br/><br/>to the friendly polis in Scotland.<br/><br/>With these, there was no relaxed<br/>conversation about anything.<br/><br/>I mean, it was pretty grim,<br/>I remember that.<br/><br/>You know, there were folk getting<br/>their phone tapped.<br/><br/>And it did, it did have an effect.<br/><br/>In a climate of fear and suspicion,<br/><br/>the Dark Harvest protests were vilified<br/><br/>by the press and politicians.<br/><br/>The Ministry of Defence called their<br/>action incredibly irresponsible,<br/><br/>and they warned anyone finding any<br/>other packages not to touch them.<br/><br/>But the mysterious group<br/>wrong-footed the authorities again<br/><br/>when it was discovered<br/>that the second package<br/><br/>placed in the Blackpool Tower was<br/>actually harmless, uninfected soil.<br/><br/>The MOD were interrogating,<br/>the Special Police Task Force<br/><br/>were investigating, and<br/>the press were digging.<br/><br/>Oh, we went after it big time.<br/>And it was a really exciting story,<br/><br/>of course it was.<br/><br/>It's a story which it<br/>seemed the authorities<br/><br/>couldn't get to the bottom of.<br/><br/>We kind of thought maybe<br/><br/>we had some pretty good candidates.<br/><br/>Iain found out about a hidden community<br/><br/>just across the bay from Gruinard.<br/><br/>This film is about Scoraig,<br/><br/>in the Western Highlands of Scotland.<br/><br/>There are two ways of getting there -<br/><br/>by footpath through the hills,<br/><br/>or by sea,<br/><br/>across what in past times was<br/>called the loch of the many winds.<br/><br/>Scoraig was a small alternative community<br/><br/>inhabited by anti-establishment<br/>environmentalists,<br/><br/>and all off grid.<br/><br/>Topher Dawson, in his boathouse at<br/>the very centre of the community,<br/><br/>is well-placed to observe the passing sea.<br/><br/>Topher set up, without much previous<br/>experience, as a boat builder.<br/><br/>They thought we were all<br/>hippies, which we weren't, but...<br/><br/>..we were different,<br/>and it was kind of homespun.<br/><br/>It wasn't like,<br/>"Let's set up a commune."<br/><br/>It was just people arrived one at a time<br/><br/>and gradually it evolved something.<br/><br/>Well, the house is round.<br/><br/>This is the stairs going up to my<br/>bed, which hangs from the ceiling.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's a bed or a bedroom.<br/><br/>I haven't really worked that out.<br/><br/>People were conscious that we couldn't live<br/><br/>the way we're living.<br/><br/>They wanted to grow as much<br/>of their own food as possible,<br/><br/>to recycle stuff and re-use stuff.<br/><br/>And we were very definitely<br/>against nuclear weapons,<br/><br/>and so by extension, bio-warfare too.<br/><br/>We all kind of disapproved<br/>of it and felt that<br/><br/>it was a pretty irresponsible thing to do.<br/><br/>Gruinard was just a short<br/>boat trip away from Scoraig.<br/><br/>I'd be astonished if the cops<br/>didn't look at Scoraig,<br/><br/>because they were living<br/>an alternative lifestyle.<br/><br/>They weren't terribly impressed<br/>with the establishment in general.<br/><br/>If you wanted to call them hippies,<br/><br/>nonconformist of one kind or another,<br/><br/>well, I suppose that's a<br/>qualification for the kind of people<br/><br/>who might've been in Dark Harvest.<br/><br/>It's called gossip, and a lot<br/>of people don't like gossip.<br/><br/>I mean...<br/><br/>..I suppose there's a<br/>fine line between that<br/><br/>and talking behind people's back.<br/><br/>I got rung up by this reporter,<br/>and he said,<br/><br/>"Come on, go on, you<br/>can tell me. Who did it?"<br/><br/>And I-I couldn't tell him anything.<br/><br/>I do definitely remember coming<br/>home and people saying to me,<br/><br/>"Oh, you missed this<br/>great excitement!"<br/><br/>I do remember that.<br/><br/>Topher cannot account for his exact<br/>whereabouts at the time of the raid,<br/><br/>but he insists he<br/>wasn't on Gruinard Island.<br/><br/>I don't know how many people<br/>could think of an alibi for,<br/><br/>I don't know, two, three days,<br/>40 years ago.<br/><br/>I can't.<br/><br/>You weren't driving down to Blackpool?<br/><br/>Oh, no.<br/><br/>After two months,<br/>the investigation was going nowhere.<br/><br/>Nobody in the wee coastal<br/>villages of Wester Ross<br/><br/>was talking to the police.<br/><br/>They didn't want to say anything that would<br/><br/>take us to a neighbour or to a relation.<br/><br/>There were no clues, no<br/>trace of the soil to be found.<br/><br/>And everyone was thinking,<br/>"I wonder who the hell did that?"<br/><br/>Running possible candidates past.<br/><br/>In our household, there was definitely<br/><br/>a name thrown about of<br/>someone who was local.<br/><br/>Mm-hm.<br/><br/>A neighbour of mine on Scoraig,<br/><br/>he was being pestered by several reporters,<br/><br/>and in the end, he said,<br/><br/>"The person you should speak<br/>to is that Topher Dawson.<br/><br/>"He's got a degree in microbiology<br/>from Cambridge University."<br/><br/>And, of course, that got them very excited.<br/><br/>I don't have a degree in microbiology.<br/><br/>I'm an engineer.<br/><br/>That's what I... I know<br/>nothing about biology.<br/><br/>But he really...<br/>He really dropped me in it.<br/><br/>In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins<br/><br/>As the end of 1981 approached,<br/><br/>it seemed everyone was aware of<br/>the poisoned island of Gruinard.<br/><br/>Dark Harvest put that<br/>story front and centre.<br/><br/>They succeeded in putting<br/>the spotlight on what was,<br/><br/>when you think about it,<br/>an absolute scandal.<br/><br/>They claimed to have 300lbs<br/>worth of infected soil,<br/><br/>and no-one knew where<br/>they would strike next.<br/><br/># I can feel it coming in the air tonight<br/><br/># Oh lord... #<br/><br/>A new letter appeared...<br/><br/>..pinned to the door of<br/>the Scottish Office.<br/><br/>You have a kind of heart in mouth moment.<br/><br/>What have they done now?<br/><br/>Instead of threats,<br/><br/>the letter declared that the aims<br/>of the protest had been met,<br/><br/>and there would be no further<br/>action... for now.<br/><br/>They thought they'd done enough.<br/><br/>They were suspending the operation.<br/><br/>Just as mysteriously as they'd appeared,<br/><br/>the Dark Harvest Commandos disappeared.<br/><br/>In 1986, locals again<br/>watched as the men in white<br/><br/>returned to the island.<br/><br/>Today, Gruinard is a hive<br/>of almost surreal activity<br/><br/>as teams of scientists,<br/>vaccinated against anthrax<br/><br/>and dressed in protective clothing,<br/><br/>prepare to return the<br/>island to its natural state.<br/><br/>The Government had to act<br/>and clean up the island.<br/><br/>There's quite a lot of<br/>political pressure on us.<br/><br/>I mean, to be frank, it is<br/>a political embarrassment.<br/><br/>I just remember we were all delighted.<br/><br/>Somebody's done something.<br/><br/>Rows of tubing, not unlike garden hose,<br/><br/>but infinitely more sophisticated,<br/><br/>will spray the infected areas with<br/>hundreds of gallons of sea water<br/><br/>and a chemical, formaldehyde.<br/><br/>11 of the 500 acres of the island<br/><br/>were treated with this toxic solution,<br/><br/>and the Gruinard soil was<br/>again tested at Porton Down.<br/><br/>Hundreds of soil samples<br/>are being analysed,<br/><br/>but it's almost certain that the island<br/><br/>is virtually clear of anthrax,<br/><br/>though there are likely to be a few<br/>deeply buried spores left,<br/><br/>and anyway, no test is foolproof.<br/><br/>The scientists worked to find out<br/><br/>if they had solved<br/>the problem they created.<br/><br/>But for the authorities,<br/><br/>the investigation into who carried<br/>out the Dark Harvest operation<br/><br/>remained unsolved.<br/><br/>And the mystery would<br/>deepen some years later<br/><br/>when an investigative<br/>journalist uncovered evidence<br/><br/>that implicated a<br/>fiery Scottish politician.<br/><br/>It was after I came up to<br/>Scotland that I became interested<br/><br/>in Dark Harvest Commandos<br/><br/>and a Glasgow lawyer called Willie McRae.<br/><br/>William McRae, the SNP candidate,<br/><br/>was born in Wester Ross and<br/>is now a solicitor in Glasgow.<br/><br/>The name of Willie McRae must be linked.<br/><br/>Thinking about who lived in the area,<br/><br/>he was an activist there.<br/><br/>It was the area he had aspired<br/>to represent in Parliament.<br/><br/>And I say that, so far<br/>as Scotland is concerned,<br/><br/>that is a standing disgrace,<br/><br/>and the primary scandal of<br/>over 250 years of union.<br/><br/>He was a great deal more<br/>nationalist than most people,<br/><br/>than most nationalists, you know.<br/><br/>We say it's Scotland's oil.<br/><br/>We expect to control and spend<br/>the revenue on Scotland's oil.<br/><br/>Willie McRae was a vocal<br/>campaigner who successfully opposed<br/><br/>the contamination of Scottish<br/>soil with nuclear waste.<br/><br/>He attracted quite a lot of admirers<br/><br/>because of his skilled opposition to this.<br/><br/>Among those was Adam Busby.<br/><br/>I would only condone violence<br/>as a last resort anyway.<br/><br/>What do you mean by a last resort?<br/><br/>I mean, as a last resort.<br/>I can't really define it.<br/><br/>An incendiary device<br/>addressed to the Prime...<br/><br/>An incendiary device<br/>inside a letter went...<br/><br/>Adam Busby was a violent extremist,<br/><br/>who would go on to organise<br/>a campaign of letter bombs<br/><br/>and intimidation to further the aims<br/><br/>of the Scottish National Liberation Army.<br/><br/>Adam Busby was a person of great<br/>interest to the authorities.<br/><br/>And then you go into a much more<br/>sinister aspect of the whole story.<br/><br/>Adam Busby was a young man with<br/><br/>even more fierce nationalist views.<br/><br/>He was friendly with Willie.<br/><br/>I know that Adam had<br/>very high regard for Willie.<br/><br/>The self-declared leader of<br/>the SNLA claimed that Willie McRae<br/><br/>had been the inspiration<br/>behind Dark Harvest.<br/><br/>Adam Busby told me that this<br/>was the idea of Willie McRae.<br/><br/>Willie McRae's suggestion was what<br/>about giving the English Government<br/><br/>a taste of its own medicine?<br/><br/>They want to dump nuclear waste here -<br/><br/>why don't you dump<br/>anthrax-contaminated soil on them?<br/><br/>Busby, however, was known<br/>for self-promotion,<br/><br/>hoaxes and false claims,<br/>and even for fellow radicals,<br/><br/>he's an unreliable witness.<br/><br/>Adam Busby, now, he said he<br/>was involved with Dark Harvest,<br/><br/>but I very much doubt that.<br/><br/>He claimed a lot more than that.<br/>He claimed everything.<br/><br/>Every dog in the street that was<br/>run over, almost -<br/><br/>we used to laugh - Busby claimed it.<br/><br/>Things that were done by other<br/>groups, he claimed it.<br/><br/>Busby's later actions seem<br/>much less sophisticated<br/><br/>than the Gruinard raiders.<br/><br/>But there is a theory that<br/>the style of the letter<br/><br/>indicates some involvement of McRae.<br/><br/>I met Willie McRae once,<br/>heard lots of speeches by him,<br/><br/>and the dramatic language,<br/>the almost biblical language,<br/><br/>in parts, of the letter betrays<br/>many of his personal traits.<br/><br/>McRae joined a list of possible suspects,<br/><br/>each with different motives<br/>but the same aim.<br/><br/>It's really about getting<br/>the island decontaminated<br/><br/>on behalf of the local community.<br/><br/>After being forced to act,<br/>after millions of pounds,<br/><br/>after years of spraying and sampling,<br/><br/>the MOD declared Gruinard anthrax free.<br/><br/>It was a moment of joy<br/>for the people of Gruinard Bay<br/><br/>and a victory for those<br/>watching from the shadows.<br/><br/>The people who carried out<br/>the Dark Harvest Commando operation<br/><br/>should've been patted on the back<br/><br/>for trying to bring to<br/>the public's attention<br/><br/>what had gone on up there.<br/><br/>I think they're to be commended,<br/>to be quite frank with you.<br/><br/>It was a really effective<br/>and imaginative action,<br/><br/>and it resulted in a clean up,<br/>so I think they're good guys.<br/><br/>And that should have been<br/>the end of this sorry tale.<br/><br/>Extensive testing of the island<br/>soil meant it was deemed safe<br/><br/>for people to once again go to Gruinard.<br/><br/>But there was a final twist<br/>that wrong-footed MOD officials<br/><br/>and raised serious questions<br/>about secrecy and safety.<br/><br/>The second letter that had been<br/><br/>pinned to the door of the Scottish Office<br/><br/>not only signalled the successful<br/>end of the Dark Harvest campaign,<br/><br/>it also contained a startling new claim<br/><br/>that has implications to this day.<br/><br/>That's when they also<br/>revealed that the soil<br/><br/>had not actually come<br/>from Gruinard Island at all,<br/><br/>it had been taken from<br/>the mainland opposite Gruinard.<br/><br/>That actually it's from the mainland.<br/><br/>It's not just the island that's infected,<br/><br/>this is a much more serious risk,<br/><br/>and far more irresponsible.<br/><br/>At the time, the authorities publicly said,<br/><br/>"We do not really have<br/>any evidence to justify<br/><br/>"doing tests on the mainland."<br/><br/>But recently declassified<br/>documents show that Dark Harvest<br/><br/>forced the MOD to reassess<br/>their wartime experiments<br/><br/>and that their secret findings<br/>were extremely concerning.<br/><br/>"On at least one occasion,<br/>a test was performed<br/><br/>"when the surface wind direction<br/>was at the limit of safety.<br/><br/>"It is possible that one or more<br/>clouds of the anthrax aerosol<br/><br/>"passed over the mainland coast."<br/><br/>Forensic examination of these once<br/>secret documents is revealing.<br/><br/>This clearly accepts that<br/>some clouds of anthrax<br/><br/>could've blown over from<br/>the island to the mainland,<br/><br/>and that there was no absolute guarantee<br/><br/>there could be no contamination.<br/><br/>"It would be extraordinarily<br/>expensive to sample and measure<br/><br/>"the area that<br/>could've been affected."<br/><br/>"I do not believe that it<br/>would be sensible to disturb<br/><br/>"the sleeping dog of whether<br/>there is any anthrax contamination<br/><br/>"on either of the two headlands<br/>downwind of Gruinard Island."<br/><br/>So what he's saying is we<br/>should just let it lie<br/><br/>and hope that it will go away.<br/><br/>Timescale over which spores<br/>can exist is 40 to 50 years,<br/><br/>but under some conditions might<br/>even be viable after 200 years.<br/><br/>I think if somebody were<br/>to provide new evidence<br/><br/>that there are anthrax spores in<br/>the environment on the mainland,<br/><br/>then, you know, that would be a concern.<br/><br/>These documents raise questions<br/>about whether the MOD in Porton Down<br/><br/>in the 1980s, in the wake of the<br/>Dark Harvest incident, were honest.<br/><br/>But if it's true, there's been no<br/>serious clean-up of the wider area,<br/><br/>the story's not over.<br/><br/>Today, for those touring the Highlands,<br/><br/>Gruinard is just another picturesque<br/>little island off the coast,<br/><br/>and anyone can go there.<br/><br/>But the legacy of its<br/>past lingers in the mind,<br/><br/>if no longer on the land.<br/><br/>You sort of feel, when you<br/>travel through that area,<br/><br/>this terrible irony between<br/>the beauty of the landscape<br/><br/>and the horror of what has happened there.<br/><br/>It is a real conflict.<br/><br/>The fact that something so<br/>impossibly awful happened<br/><br/>in such a beautiful place does<br/>add a lot of psychological depth.<br/><br/>There are a number of MOD documents<br/>that remain sealed until 2069...<br/><br/>..and the question of who were<br/>the Dark Harvest Commandos<br/><br/>remains unanswered.<br/><br/>Were you involved in Dark Harvest?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>And I know nothing whatsoever<br/>about who was involved.<br/><br/>Kay Matheson wasn't backward<br/>in promoting the cause<br/><br/>that she obviously felt<br/>very strongly about.<br/><br/>But by the early 1980s,<br/>she was standing for MP,<br/><br/>and I would suspect that<br/>she was perhaps trying<br/><br/>to keep her nose clean.<br/><br/>I think the Gruinard story<br/>was probably pivotal for us<br/><br/>because it made us<br/>realise, actually, how sensitive<br/><br/>the Government was to groups like ours.<br/><br/>Were you involved<br/>in the taking of the soil?<br/><br/>In an era before eco-warriors<br/>and direct action,<br/><br/>this protest saved at least<br/>one small piece of the Earth.<br/><br/>It's a bit like Greenpeace before<br/>Greenpeace got famous, I think.<br/><br/>Would you have liked to have done it?<br/><br/>I kind of, you know, it would be...<br/><br/>..it would be something<br/>you could be proud of.<br/><br/>You know what I mean?<br/><br/>It's a kind of exciting exploit,<br/><br/>and I just wish I could say that<br/>I was part of it, cos I wasn't.<br/><br/>I wish I had been.<br/><br/>I would love to have been<br/>that person, but I wasn't.<br/><br/>The people of the Highlands<br/><br/>could once again set foot on Gruinard soil.<br/><br/>Apart, that is, from the 300lbs<br/>worth of contaminated soil removed,<br/><br/>put into sacks and hidden<br/>away by Dark Harvest.<br/><br/>To this day, it's never been recovered.<br/><br/>The tourists who follow the North Coast 500<br/><br/>up past beautiful Gruinard Bay<br/>might want to take care<br/><br/>if they spot an old sack of soil<br/><br/>behind a Highland hideout.</div>
